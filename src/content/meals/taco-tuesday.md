## Meal Overview

The iconic Tuesday tradition—build-your-own tacos with all the fixings. The beauty is in the customization: set out the components and let everyone assemble their perfect taco. Quick, fun, and universally loved.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Start rice** - 35 minutes, set and forget
2. **Prep toppings** - shred cheese, chop cilantro, slice limes, dice onions
3. **Cook black beans** - warm through with spices
4. **Cook taco filling** - ground beef or chicken, 10-15 minutes
5. **Warm tortillas** - in a dry skillet or wrapped in foil in oven
6. **Set up taco bar** - all components in serving dishes

## Notes

- Offer both flour and corn tortillas
- Add pickled jalapeños and hot sauce for the adventurous
- Leftover filling makes great next-day burrito bowls
