## Meal Overview

A vibrant poke-style bowl featuring glazed salmon over rice with customizable toppings. The sweet-spicy glaze caramelizes beautifully, and the bowl format makes this endlessly adaptable to whatever vegetables you have on hand.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Start rice** - 35 minutes
2. **Make glaze** - whisk honey, sriracha, soy sauce
3. **Prep bowl toppings** - slice avocado, cucumber, etc.
4. **Cook edamame** - 5 minutes in boiling water
5. **Pan-sear or bake salmon** with glaze - 10-12 minutes
6. **Assemble bowls** - rice base, salmon, toppings, drizzle extra glaze

## Notes

- Add sliced avocado and pickled ginger for the full experience
- Swap salmon for tofu for a vegetarian version
- Make extra rice for meal prep lunches
