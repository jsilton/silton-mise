## Meal Overview

The American comfort food trifecta—crispy-skinned chicken, creamy mashed potatoes, and bright green broccoli. Buttermilk marinating makes the chicken incredibly tender while the baking method keeps things simple. A crowd-pleaser for all ages.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Marinate chicken** in buttermilk (30 min minimum, overnight ideal)
2. **Start chicken in oven** - 45 minutes at 400°F
3. **Boil potatoes** while chicken bakes
4. **Mash potatoes** when tender, keep warm
5. **Steam broccoli** in last 10 minutes of chicken cooking
6. **Rest chicken** briefly, then serve

## Notes

- The buttermilk tenderizes and adds tang—don't skip it
- Add garlic to the mashed potatoes for extra flavor
- Save pan drippings for gravy if desired
