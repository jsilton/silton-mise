## Meal Overview

A light but satisfying weeknight dinner featuring miso-glazed salmon that caramelizes beautifully under the broiler. The umami-rich glaze creates a sweet-savory crust while keeping the fish moist. The smashed cucumber salad adds a cool, crunchy contrast that complements the rich fish. Quick enough for any weeknight, elegant enough for date night.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Marinate salmon** for at least 15 minutes (or up to overnight)
2. **Start rice** - 35 minutes total
3. **Prep salad** - wash greens, make dressing, keep separate
4. **Broil salmon** - 8-10 minutes, watch for caramelization
5. **Dress salad** while salmon rests briefly
6. **Plate** - rice, salmon, salad on the side

## Notes

- The miso glaze also works on chicken thighs
- Add a drizzle of sesame oil to finish the salmon
- Upgrade with a squeeze of fresh lemon over everything
