## Meal Overview

Better-than-takeout lo mein with silky noodles, crisp vegetables, and savory sauce. The cucumber salad adds a bright, cool contrast to the warm noodles, making this a balanced weeknight meal.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Make cucumber salad first** - needs 15+ minutes to marinate
2. **Prep all stir-fry ingredients** - slice vegetables, make sauce
3. **Boil noodles** - slightly undercook, they'll finish in the wok
4. **Steam broccoli** while prepping
5. **Stir-fry vegetables** - high heat, quick cooking
6. **Add noodles and sauce** - toss until coated
7. **Serve immediately** with cucumber salad on the side

## Notes

- Fresh lo mein noodles are best, but dried work in a pinch
- Add extra vegetables based on what's in the fridge
- Leftovers reheat well in a hot pan with a splash of water
