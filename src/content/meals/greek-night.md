## Meal Overview

Transport yourself to the Mediterranean with juicy lamb burgers topped with cool tzatziki, alongside a classic Greek salad with big chunks of feta. Light enough for warm weather but satisfying enough to fill you up.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Make tzatziki** first - it benefits from resting
2. **Start rice** if serving (optional - can skip for lighter meal)
3. **Prep Greek salad** - chop vegetables, arrange on platter
4. **Form and season lamb patties**
5. **Grill or pan-fry burgers** - 4-5 minutes per side for medium
6. **Dress salad** while burgers rest
7. **Serve open-faced** or in pita with generous tzatziki

## Notes

- Lamb fat keeps burgers juicy; don't go too lean
- Serve in warmed pita bread for a more authentic experience
- The tzatziki doubles as salad dressing
