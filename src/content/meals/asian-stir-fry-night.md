## Meal Overview

A classic Chinese-American weeknight dinner that comes together quickly once you have your mise en place ready. The mongolian beef is the star, with tender slices in a sweet-savory sauce, while the rice and greens round out the plate with texture contrast.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Start the rice first** - it takes 35 minutes and can hold
2. **Prep all stir-fry ingredients** while rice cooks - slice beef, mince garlic, measure sauces
3. **Cook the spinach** - quick sauté, set aside to stay warm
4. **Steam the broccoli** - 5-7 minutes while prepping beef
5. **Finish with mongolian beef** - hot and fast, serve immediately

## Notes

- Double the rice if you want leftovers for lunch bowls
- The spinach can be swapped for steamed bok choy
- Add a fried egg on top for extra protein
