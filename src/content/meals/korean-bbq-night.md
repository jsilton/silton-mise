## Meal Overview

Bring the Korean BBQ experience home with marinated short ribs, fluffy rice, and banchan. The ribs need advance marinating but cook in minutes, making this perfect for grilling season entertaining.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Marinate ribs overnight** (or at least 4 hours) - plan ahead
2. **Make kimchi** a day or two ahead if homemade, or use store-bought
3. **Start rice** 40 minutes before grilling
4. **Prep spinach ingredients** while rice cooks
5. **Grill ribs** hot and fast, 2-3 minutes per side
6. **Quick-cook spinach** while ribs rest
7. **Serve family-style** with scissors to cut ribs at the table

## Notes

- Flanken-cut short ribs work best for this preparation
- Add lettuce leaves for ssam (wraps) if desired
- Gochujang on the side for those who want more heat
