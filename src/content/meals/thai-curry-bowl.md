## Meal Overview

A warming, aromatic curry bowl that's deceptively easy to make. The coconut milk base is rich and comforting, while the curry paste does all the heavy lifting on flavor. Perfect for meal prep—the curry actually improves overnight.

## Cooking Strategy

1. **Start rice** - set it and forget it
2. **Prep curry ingredients** - dice chicken, slice vegetables
3. **Build the curry** - bloom paste in coconut cream, add chicken, simmer
4. **Steam broccoli** in the last 10 minutes
5. **Assemble bowls** - rice base, curry ladled over, broccoli on the side

## Notes

- Red, green, or yellow curry paste all work—choose your heat level
- Add Thai basil at the end for authenticity
- Leftovers reheat beautifully for lunch bowls
