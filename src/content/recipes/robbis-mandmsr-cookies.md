## Chef's Note
This is a **Modern Heritage** update to a family favorite. The secret to the Silton Standard is **The Surface Press Pattern**: we fold only 3/4 of the M&M's into the dough, then press the remaining candies into the tops of the dough balls *after* scooping. This ensures a professional visual "High Note" where the colors stay vibrant and don't bleed into the batter. We use a high ratio of brown sugar to ensure a chewy "Bounce" that contrasts the "Snap" of the candy shell.

## Directions

1.  **Cream:** In a large bowl, beat the shortening (or butter) with both sugars until light and fluffy (2 mins). Add eggs and vanilla; beat until emulsified.
2.  **Dry Mix:** Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add to the wet mix until **just combined**.
3.  **Inclusions:** Fold in 1 cup of the M&M's. 
4.  **Shape:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Drop teaspoon-sized balls of dough onto ungreased sheets. 
5.  **Press:** Press 3-4 of the remaining M&M's into the top of each ball.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 9-11 minutes until the edges are just golden. Do not over-bake; they will set on the pan.
7.  **Cool:** Let rest on the pan for 5 minutes to ensure **Texture Integrity**.
