## Chef's Note

Folding only 3/4 of the M&M's into the dough, then pressing the remaining candies into the tops of the dough balls after scooping ensures vibrant colors stay visible on the finished cookies instead of bleeding into the batter during baking. Using a high ratio of brown sugar to white sugar creates chewy cookies that contrast the crisp candy shell.

## Directions

1.  **Cream:** In a large bowl, beat the shortening (or butter) with both sugars until light and fluffy (2 mins). Add eggs and vanilla; beat until emulsified.
2.  **Dry Mix:** Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add to the wet mix until **just combined**.
3.  **Inclusions:** Fold in 1 cup of the M&M's.
4.  **Shape:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Drop teaspoon-sized balls of dough onto ungreased sheets.
5.  **Press:** Press 3-4 of the remaining M&M's into the top of each ball.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 9-11 minutes until the edges are just golden. Do not over-bake; they will set on the pan.
7.  **Cool:** Let rest on the pan for 5 minutes to ensure proper texture.
