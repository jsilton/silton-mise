## Chef's Note

Mastering the soufflé is about **Culinary Technique**, not luck. We use the **Aeration Method**: we whip egg whites with cream of tartar to stabilize the protein bubbles, then gently fold in a rich brown-butter chocolate base. The secret to the height is the **Nutty Butter Coating**: we brush the dish with chilled brown butter and sugar, creating a "ladder" that allows the batter to climb the walls of the dish as it rises. Serve immediately—minimal deflation is the goal, but the flavor remains elite regardless.

## Directions

1.  **The Ladder:** Cook butter in a skillet over medium heat until it foams and turns nutty brown (4 mins). Chill until spreadable (20 mins). Brush the bottom and sides of a chilled soufflé dish with the brown butter. Coat with 1/4 cup superfine sugar and tap out excess. Chill dish.
2.  **The Ganache:** Preheat oven to 475°F. Melt chocolate into 1/2 cup steaming heavy cream. Whisk until smooth. Whisk in egg yolks one at a time.
3.  **The Flavor Layer:** Whisk cocoa powder, rum, salt, and 1/2 cup hot water. Stir this into the chocolate ganache.
4.  **The Meringue:** Using a mixer, beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and 1/3 cup sugar until glossy, stiff peaks form (5-7 mins). Do not over-whip; they should look like softly whipped cream.
5.  **The Fold:** Gently fold the chocolate mixture into the egg whites. Use a "cut and fold" motion to preserve the air bubbles.
6.  **Bake:** Transfer to the prepared dish. Sprinkle 1 tbsp sugar on top. **Bake at 475°F** for 25-30 minutes until puffed and set with a slight wobble in the center.
7.  **Serve:** Dust with powdered sugar and serve immediately with extra heavy cream.
