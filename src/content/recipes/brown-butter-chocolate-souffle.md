title: 'Brown Butter–Chocolate Soufflé'
ingredients:
  - 'Mastering the art of soufflé-making is easier than you might think so long as you follow these three rules: Never overwhip the egg whites (look for the consistency of softly whipped cream); always use a very hot oven; and remember to keep calm. Even for professionals there comes a moment when doubts seem to rise faster than the soufflé itself. But maintain your cool and it all usually works out just fine. Ideal for Passover, this gluten- and flour-free version gets layers of flavor from nutty brown butter. Serve straight from the oven for maximum impact—and minimal deflation.'
  - '½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter'
  - '¼ cup (56 g) plus ⅓ cup (75 g) superfine sugar, plus more for sprinkling'
  - '3.5 oz. bittersweet chocolate (70% cacao), chopped'
  - '½ cup heavy cream, plus more for serving'
  - '3 large eggs, room temperature, separated'
  - '½ cup (50 g) Dutch-process cocoa powder'
  - '1 Tbsp. dark rum (optional)'
  - '½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt'
  - '¼ tsp. cream of tartar'
  - 'Powdered sugar (for serving; kosher for Passover if desired)'
  - 'SPECIAL EQUIPMENT: A 1½-qt. soufflé dish'

Mastering the art of soufflé-making is easier than you might think so long as you follow these three rules: Never overwhip the egg whites (look for the consistency of softly whipped cream); always use a very hot oven; and remember to keep calm. Even for professionals there comes a moment when doubts seem to rise faster than the soufflé itself. But maintain your cool and it all usually works out just fine. Ideal for Passover, this gluten- and flour-free version gets layers of flavor from nutty brown butter. Serve straight from the oven for maximum impact—and minimal deflation.

## Directions

1. Chill soufflé dish. Cook butter in a small skillet over medium heat, swirling occasionally, until it foams, then browns, about 4 minutes. Pour into a small heatproof bowl and chill until spreadable, about 20 minutes (butter should be opaque but still soft enough to brush). Brush bottom and sides of soufflé dish with all of the butter (it will look like a lot), going all the way to the top edges. Sprinkle bottom and sides with ¼ cup (56 g) superfine sugar and tilt dish to coat in an even layer; tap out excess. Chill until ready to use. Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 475°. Place chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Heat ½ cup cream in a small saucepan over medium, stirring occasionally, until steaming, about 2 minutes. Pour cream over chocolate and let sit, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula, until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth and slightly cooled, about 5 minutes. Add egg yolks one at a time, whisking until smooth between additions. Stir cocoa powder, rum (if using), salt, and ½ cup hot water in a measuring glass until combined. Pour cocoa mixture into chocolate mixture and whisk to combine. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and ¹⁄₃ cup (75 g) superfine sugar in a large bowl until glossy and stiff peaks form, 5–7 minutes.Gently fold chocolate mixture into egg whites until just combined. Transfer to prepared soufflé dish and evenly sprinkle about 1 Tbsp. superfine sugar over. Bake soufflé until puffed and top is slightly darkened and just set with a slight wobble in the center when gently shaken, 25–30 minutes. To serve, dust soufflé with powdered sugar and spoon onto plates. Drizzle with cream.
