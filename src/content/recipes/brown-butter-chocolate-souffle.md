## Chef's Note

This French technique relies on properly whipped egg whites stabilized with cream of tartar, then carefully folded into chocolate ganache to preserve air bubbles. Brushing the chilled dish with brown butter and sugar creates a textured coating that helps batter climb the walls as it rises. Serve immediately - some deflation is natural, but flavor remains excellent.

## Directions

1.  **The Ladder:** Cook butter in a skillet over medium heat until it foams and turns nutty brown (4 mins). Chill until spreadable (20 mins). Brush the bottom and sides of a chilled soufflé dish with the brown butter. Coat with 1/4 cup superfine sugar and tap out excess. Chill dish.
2.  **The Ganache:** Preheat oven to 475°F. Melt chocolate into 1/2 cup steaming heavy cream. Whisk until smooth. Whisk in egg yolks one at a time.
3.  **The Flavor Layer:** Whisk cocoa powder, rum, salt, and 1/2 cup hot water. Stir this into the chocolate ganache.
4.  **The Meringue:** Using a mixer, beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and 1/3 cup sugar until glossy, stiff peaks form (5-7 mins). Do not over-whip; they should look like softly whipped cream.
5.  **The Fold:** Gently fold the chocolate mixture into the egg whites. Use a "cut and fold" motion to preserve the air bubbles.
6.  **Bake:** Transfer to the prepared dish. Sprinkle 1 tbsp sugar on top. **Bake at 475°F** for 25-30 minutes until puffed and set with a slight wobble in the center.
7.  **Serve:** Dust with powdered sugar and serve immediately with extra heavy cream.
