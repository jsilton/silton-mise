A restaurant-style Saag using frozen spinach for perfect texture and the soak method to keep the Paneer cheese soft and spongy.

## Directions

1. Prep Spinach: Squeeze the thawed spinach in a colander or with your hands to remove most of the excess water.
2. Fry & Soak Paneer: Heat oil in a non-stick skillet. Fry paneer cubes until golden on two sides. Immediately transfer fried cubes into a bowl of hot tap water to soak. (This keeps them soft).
3. Sauté Aromatics: In the same skillet, add 1 tbsp Ghee. Sauté the onion for 8 minutes until browned. Add garlic, ginger, and jalapeno; fry for 2 minutes.
4. Spices & Greens: Stir in coriander, turmeric, and salt. Add the squeezed spinach and stir well to coat in the spiced oil. Cook for 2–3 minutes.
5. Cream: Reduce heat to low. Stir in heavy cream.
6. Combine: Drain the paneer cubes and gently fold them into the spinach.
7. Finish: Turn off heat. Stir in Garam Masala and crushed Kasuri Methi. Cover and let sit for 3-5 minutes before serving to let flavors meld.

## Notes

The Soak Step is critical, if you skip soaking the fried paneer in hot water, it will be tough and rubbery.Use Chopped frozen spinach, not whole leaf, for the correct texture.
