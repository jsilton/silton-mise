## Chef's Note

A restaurant-quality apple pie requires **Physics**. We use the **Vodka Hack**: replacing half the water with cold vodka prevents gluten from forming (alcohol doesn't trigger gluten), resulting in a crust that is impossibly flaky and easy to roll. We also **Pre-Cook the Filling**: by sautéing the apples and reducing their juices into a caramel before baking, we prevent the "soggy bottom" and ensure the pie has no massive air gap under the top crust.

## Directions

1.  **The Crust:** Pulse flour, sugar, salt, and butter in a food processor until pea-sized bits remain. Add vodka and water. Pulse until just combined. Wrap in plastic and **chill for at least 1 hour**.
2.  **The Filling:** Peel and slice apples. Toss with lemon juice and sugar.
3.  **The Reduction:** In a large skillet, melt butter. Add apples and cook for 7 minutes until they release their juices. Drain apples in a colander, **catching the juice**.
4.  **Caramelize:** Return the juice to the skillet. Boil for 5-8 minutes until it turns into a thick syrup. Toss the syrup and spices back with the apples. Let cool completely.
5.  **Roll:** Roll out bottom crust. Fill with cooled apples. Roll out top crust and seal edges. Cut 4 steam vents.
6.  **Wash:** Brush with beaten egg and sprinkle with sugar.
7.  **Bake:** Bake at 375°F for 50 minutes on the **lowest rack** (to ensure the bottom crust gets direct heat).
8.  **Cool:** Let cool for at least 2 hours before slicing.
