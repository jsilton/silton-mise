## Chef's Note

The difference between average cornbread and exceptional cornbread is the skillet method. You must preheat your cast-iron skillet with the butter inside until it is screaming hot and foaming. When you pour the cold batter into the hot oil, it creates an immediate deep-gold crust on the bottom that is unattainable in a cold baking dish. The buttermilk and baking soda reaction provides the necessary texture and lift.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Place a 9-inch cast-iron skillet in the oven and preheat to 375°F.
2.  **Dry Mix:** In a medium bowl, whisk together cornmeal, flour, and salt.
3.  **Wet Mix:** In a separate bowl, whisk the buttermilk and baking soda until bubbly. Whisk in the eggs.
4.  **The Sizzle:** Carefully remove the hot skillet from the oven using mitts. Add the 1/2 cup butter and swirl until completely melted and starting to brown.
5.  **The Emulsion:** Pour the melted butter into the sugar in a large bowl; whisk well. Add the buttermilk mixture.
6.  **Combine:** Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet. Stir until **just combined** (a few lumps are mandatory for texture).
7.  **Bake:** Pour the batter into the hot, buttered skillet. Bake for 25-30 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the edges are pulled away from the pan.
8.  **Serve:** Serve warm directly from the skillet with honey and extra butter.
