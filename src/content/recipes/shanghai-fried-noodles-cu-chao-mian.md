## Chef's Note
The secret to authentic Shanghai Fried Noodles is **The Dark Soy Pattern**. Unlike other stir-fries, this dish relies on a heavy hit of dark soy sauce to achieve a deep, mahogany lacquer and a subtle sweetness. We use **Structural Science** through **The Velveting Pattern**: marinating the pork in cornstarch and wine ensures it maintains a succulent "Bounce" under the high heat of the wok. We maintain **Texture Integrity** by using thick udon noodles, which provide a chewy, resilient "Snap" against the soft bok choy.

## Directions

1.  **Velvet:** Toss pork strips with cornstarch, wine, and soy sauce. Let stand for 10 minutes.
2.  **The Sear:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok until smoking. Sear the pork for 2 minutes until browned. Remove.
3.  **The Snap:** Add 1 tbsp oil. Sauté shiitakes for 2 minutes. Add the noodles and use your hands to gently separate them. 
4.  **Glaze:** Add both soy sauces and sugar. Stir-fry for 3 minutes over high heat until the noodles are evenly dark and glossy.
5.  **Finish:** Add the bok choy and the cooked pork. Toss for 1 minute until the greens are just wilted but the stems stay crunchy.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately. Add a dash of Chinese black vinegar at the table for the mandatory **Acid Finish**.
