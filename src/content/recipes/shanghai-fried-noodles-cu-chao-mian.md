## Chef's Note

Cu chao mian is a Shanghai classic characterized by its dark, glossy noodles coated in generous dark soy sauce for a deep mahogany color and subtle sweetness. Velveting the pork in cornstarch and Shaoxing wine keeps it tender during high-heat cooking, while thick udon noodles provide a satisfying chew against wilted bok choy.

## Directions

1.  **Velvet:** Toss pork strips with cornstarch, wine, and soy sauce. Let stand for 10 minutes.
2.  **The Sear:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok until smoking. Sear the pork for 2 minutes until browned. Remove.
3.  **The Crunch:** Add 1 tbsp oil. Sauté shiitakes for 2 minutes. Add the noodles and use your hands to gently separate them.
4.  **Glaze:** Add both soy sauces and sugar. Stir-fry for 3 minutes over high heat until the noodles are evenly dark and glossy.
5.  **Finish:** Add the bok choy and the cooked pork. Toss for 1 minute until the greens are just wilted but the stems stay crunchy.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately. Add a dash of Chinese black vinegar at the table for the mandatory **Acid Balance**.
