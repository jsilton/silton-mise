## Chef's Note
The Silton Standard for a Martini is built on **Structural Science** and the **Thermal Pattern**. We stir, never shake, to preserve the silkiness of the gin without introducing air bubbles or excessive dilution. The secret is **Cracked Ice**: by hand-cracking a large cube, we increase the surface area, allowing the drink to reach sub-zero temperatures in exactly 50 stirs. The final "High Note" is the **Expressed Lemon Oil**—rubbing the peel on the rim ensures the aroma precedes the flavor.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Chill your glass in the freezer for 10 minutes prior to starting. 
2.  **The Ice:** Hold a large ice cube in your palm and crack it into 3-4 pieces using the back of a bar spoon. Fill a mixing glass with the cracked ice and additional large cubes.
3.  **The Stir:** Add the gin and vermouth. Using a bar spoon, stir **rapidly in a circular motion** for 50 rotations. The outside of the glass should be frosted.
4.  **Strain:** Double strain using a Hawthorne strainer into your chilled Nick and Nora or Martini glass.
5.  **The Express:** Use a serrated knife or peeler to remove a 1-inch strip of lemon peel (aim for just the yellow zest, minimal white pith). Twist the peel over the glass to express the oils, rub the rim with the peel, and drop it in.
