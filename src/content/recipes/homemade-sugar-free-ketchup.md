## Chef's Note

This is a baseline **Modularity** component for nutritious focused meals. The secret to a thick, flavorful ketchup without added sugar is **The Low-Reduction Method**: we simmer the passata on the lowest possible heat for 30 minutes. This slowly evaporates the water and concentrates the natural fructose of the tomatoes, resulting in a rich Texture that mimics the consistency of commercial brands. The **Red Wine Vinegar** provides the mandatory **Acid Balance** that keeps the savory spices from becoming flat.

## Directions

1.  **Combine:** In a small non-reactive saucepan, whisk together the tomatoes, vinegar, smashed garlic, mustard, and all spices.
2.  **Reduce:** Bring to a tiny simmer over low heat. Cook for 30 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent the bottom from scorching.
3.  **Refine:** Once thickened and dark red, remove the garlic clove.
4.  **Emulsion:** For the Kitchen Standard texture, use an immersion blender to puree the mixture until perfectly smooth and glossy.
5.  **Set:** Let cool completely. Transfer to an airtight glass jar and refrigerate.
6.  **Store:** Keeps in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
