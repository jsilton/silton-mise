## Chef's Note

Simmering tomato passata on lowest heat for 30 minutes slowly evaporates water and concentrates tomatoes' natural fructose, creating thick ketchup without added sugar. Red wine vinegar provides acidity that keeps the savory spices from tasting flat.

## Directions

1.  **Combine:** In a small non-reactive saucepan, whisk together the tomatoes, vinegar, smashed garlic, mustard, and all spices.
2.  **Reduce:** Bring to a tiny simmer over low heat. Cook for 30 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent the bottom from scorching.
3.  **Refine:** Once thickened and dark red, remove the garlic clove.
4.  **Emulsion:** For the Kitchen Standard texture, use an immersion blender to puree the mixture until perfectly smooth and glossy.
5.  **Set:** Let cool completely. Transfer to an airtight glass jar and refrigerate.
6.  **Store:** Keeps in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
