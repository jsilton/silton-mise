## Chef's Note

These quick appetizers or lunch components require proper technique to avoid falling apart. Blending cream cheese with flavored oil from sun-dried tomatoes creates a tacky, flavor-rich spread that binds the fillings to the tortilla. Squeeze spinach until bone-dry—wet spinach makes tortillas soggy and causes rolls to unravel.

## Directions

1.  **The Bind:** In a food processor, blend cream cheese, garlic, a few sun-dried tomatoes, and 2 tbsp of the tomato oil until completely smooth.
2.  **Prep:** Lay out the 6 tortillas. Spread a thick, even layer of the cream cheese mixture over each, leaving a 1/2-inch border at the top.
3.  **Layer:** Scatter the chopped spinach, remaining sun-dried tomatoes, Parmesan, and feta over the cream cheese. Place a single line of fresh basil leaves across the center of each tortilla.
4.  **The Roll:** Starting from the edge parallel to the basil, roll the tortilla **very tightly**, squeezing gently as you go to ensure the "Emulsion" binds the layers.
5.  **The Finish:** Wrap each log tightly in plastic wrap and **refrigerate for at least 30 minutes** (mandatory for clean slicing).
6.  **Cut:** Using a sharp serrated knife, slice into 1-inch pinwheels.
