## Directions

1. First make the cream cheese mixture: Add cream cheese, 2 TBS garlic, 3-4 sun-dried tomatoes, salt, pepper, 5-6 basil leaves, and 2 TBS oil from the sun-dried tomatoes jar to the bowl of a food processor or blender. Blend for 30 seconds, scrape down the sides, and blend 10-15 more seconds or until completely combined. Set aside.
2. Set out 6 tortillas (I like flavored tortillas like spinach or sun-dried tomato for this recipe, but you can also use plain flour or LOW CARB).
3. Assemble: On each tortilla spread a thick layer of cream cheese, chopped spinach, chopped sun-dried tomatoes, 1 teaspoon parmesan cheese, 1-2 teaspoon feta cheese. In the center, make a line from end to end of fresh basil leaves.
4. Starting from an outer edge parallel to the basil, roll tightly while gently squeezing to keep together. Repeat for all tortillas.
5. Using a serrated knife, cut in about 1 inch pinwheels. Repeat for all tortillas.
6. Cover and refrigerate until serving. Enjoy!
