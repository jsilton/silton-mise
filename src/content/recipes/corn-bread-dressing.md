## Chef's Note

The secret to this family classic is **Textural Balance**. Most dressings are soggy; we solve this by specifically **baking the cornbread cubes** to dry them out before they hit the stock. This allows the cubes to absorb the mushroom and shallot butter like a sponge while maintaining their individual shape.

## Directions

1.  **Dry the Bread:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Spread cornbread cubes on a baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the edges are golden and the cubes feel like croutons. Cool completely.
2.  **The Base:** Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté shallots and garlic until soft (6 mins).
3.  **The Veg:** Add mushrooms and celery. Cook for 5 minutes until the mushrooms have released their liquid and are browned.
4.  **Aromatics:** Stir in parsley, thyme, and sage. Remove from heat.
5.  **Combine:** In a large bowl, toss the dried cornbread with the mushroom mixture.
6.  **Moisten:** Gradually pour in the chicken stock, tossing gently, until the bread is moist but not swimming in liquid. Season with salt and pepper.
7.  **Bake:** Transfer to a buttered baking dish. Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes until the top is crispy and golden.
