## Chef's Note

The secret to "Restaurant Quality" General Tso's in a slow cooker is **Structural Science** through **The Cornstarch Sear Pattern**. We dredge the chicken in a thick layer of starch and flash-fry it in a skillet _before_ it hits the crockpot. This creates a "Snappy" protective crust that absorbs the hoisin glaze without turning the meat into a stringy mess. The rice vinegar provides the mandatory **Acid Finish** that defines the dish's signature punch.

## Directions

1.  **The Snap:** Toss chicken pieces in a bag with cornstarch, salt, and pepper until heavily coated.
2.  **The Sear:** Heat oil in a large skillet. Flash-fry chicken for 2 minutes until a white, crispy crust forms. (The chicken will still be raw inside).
3.  **The Sauce:** In a bowl, whisk hoisin, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, ginger, and red pepper flakes.
4.  **Combine:** Place chicken in the slow cooker. Pour half the sauce over it.
5.  **Slow Cook:** Cover and cook on **Low for 4 hours**.
6.  **Glaze:** 10 minutes before serving, stir in the remaining sauce. This provides a fresh "High Note" of flavor that hasn't been muted by the heat.
7.  **Serve:** Serve over steamed rice with fresh broccoli.
