## Chef's Note

This slow-cooker version of the Chinese-American classic adapts the dish by flash-frying cornstarch-coated chicken before it enters the crockpot, creating a crispy crust that holds up during long cooking. The sauce balances hoisin's fermented sweetness with rice vinegar's bright acidity for the signature tangy-sweet profile.

## Directions

1.  **The Crunch:** Toss chicken pieces in a bag with cornstarch, salt, and pepper until heavily coated.
2.  **The Sear:** Heat oil in a large skillet. Flash-fry chicken for 2 minutes until a white, crispy crust forms. (The chicken will still be raw inside).
3.  **The Sauce:** In a bowl, whisk hoisin, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, ginger, and red pepper flakes.
4.  **Combine:** Place chicken in the slow cooker. Pour half the sauce over it.
5.  **Slow Cook:** Cover and cook on **Low for 4 hours**.
6.  **Glaze:** 10 minutes before serving, stir in the remaining sauce. This provides a fresh "High Note" of flavor that hasn't been muted by the heat.
7.  **Serve:** Serve over steamed rice with fresh broccoli.
