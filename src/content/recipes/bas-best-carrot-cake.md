## Chef's Note

This is the **Bravetart Upgrade** to the BA classic. We replace generic vegetable oil with **Brown Butter**, which provides a nutty, toasted depth that standard carrot cakes lack. We also use **Buttermilk** to ensure a tender, moist crumb that stays fresh for days. This is a true technical dish dessert that rewards the extra effort of browning and grating.

## Directions

1.  **Brown the Butter:** Melt the 3/4 cup butter until dark golden and smelling like hazelnuts. Cool.
2.  **Batter:** Whisk the brown butter, both sugars, eggs, and vanilla for 4 minutes until pale and thick.
3.  **Fold:** Whisk together the dry ingredients. Add to the butter mixture in 3 parts, alternating with the buttermilk and carrots.
4.  **Bake:** Pour into two 9-inch lined pans. Bake at 350°F for 35-45 minutes. Cool completely.
5.  **Frosting:** Beat cream cheese and butter until smooth. Add powdered sugar and vanilla.
6.  **Assemble:** Layer and frost the cakes generously.
