## Chef's Note

These are properly called "gnudi" - Italian for "naked" - because they're essentially the filling of ravioli without the pasta wrapper. They originated in Tuscany, where ricotta and spinach were abundant. The critical step is squeezing the defrosted spinach in a kitchen towel until it's bone-dry - any excess moisture means you'll need more flour, which makes the gnudi heavy and dense instead of light and pillowy. Whole-milk ricotta gives the best texture, and a pinch of nutmeg is traditional to bridge the earthy spinach and rich cheese flavors.

## Directions

1.  **The Squeeze:** Defrost spinach and squeeze in a kitchen towel until no liquid remains.
2.  **The Mix:** In a food processor, pulse the dry spinach, ricotta, Parmesan, flour, egg, nutmeg, and salt until a sticky dough forms. Do not over-process.
3.  **The Shape:** Transfer dough to a floured board. Sprinkle with more flour until it no longer sticks to your hands. Divide into 4 logs (1-inch thick).
4.  **Cut:** Slice logs into 1-inch chunks. Toss lightly with flour.
5.  **Boil:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop gnocchi in. They are done when they float to the surface (3-5 mins).
6.  **Serve:** Drain gently. Serve immediately with a high-quality tomato sauce or brown butter and sage.
