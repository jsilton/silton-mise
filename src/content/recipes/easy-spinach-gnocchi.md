## Chef's Note
These "Gnudi" are the lighter, pillowy cousin of the potato gnocchi. The secret to the Silton Standard is **Texture Integrity** through the **Dry Squeeze Pattern**: you must squeeze the defrosted spinach in a towel until it is **bone-dry**. Any excess moisture will require more flour, which turns the gnocchi into leaden pucks. We use **Whole-Milk Ricotta** for a rich "Bounce" and a pinch of **Nutmeg** as the mandatory high note to bridge the cheese and greens.

## Directions

1.  **The Squeeze:** Defrost spinach and squeeze in a kitchen towel until no liquid remains. 
2.  **The Mix:** In a food processor, pulse the dry spinach, ricotta, Parmesan, flour, egg, nutmeg, and salt until a sticky dough forms. Do not over-process.
3.  **The Shape:** Transfer dough to a floured board. Sprinkle with more flour until it no longer sticks to your hands. Divide into 4 logs (1-inch thick). 
4.  **Cut:** Slice logs into 1-inch chunks. Toss lightly with flour.
5.  **Boil:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop gnocchi in. They are done when they float to the surface (3-5 mins).
6.  **Serve:** Drain gently. Serve immediately with a high-quality tomato sauce or brown butter and sage.
