## Directions

1. Defrost the frozen spinach and squeeze out ALL excess liquid. Put the spinach, ricotta, parmesan, flour and egg in the food processor and pulse until well combined.
2. Plop the dough in one pile on a floured cutting board. Sprinkle more flour on top until the dough no longer sticks to your hands. Divide into 3 or 4 pieces and roll each one into a thin log about 1-inch in diameter. Cut the logs into 1 to 1 ½” sized chunks and toss with a little more flour.
3. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and slide in the pieces of dough. Cook until all are floating and done all the way through when cut in half, about 3 to 5 minutes. Drain and toss with salt and pepper, to taste. Serve with either a high quality store bought tomato sauce or a homemade one.
