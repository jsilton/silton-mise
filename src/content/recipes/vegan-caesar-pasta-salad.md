## Directions

1. Boil the pasta according to directions on the package. Drain, then transfer to a large bowl.
2. While pasta is cooking, you can make the vegan Caesar dressing. Once done, toss the dressing in the bowl with the cooked pasta until well combined.
3. Next, add in the romaine, sliced avocado, halved tomatoes and roasted chickpeas; toss again until well combined. Add more salt and pepper to taste. Caesar salads usually need to have a decent amount of salt in order for the flavor to be spot on, so be generous with your salt and pepper! Serves 4.
