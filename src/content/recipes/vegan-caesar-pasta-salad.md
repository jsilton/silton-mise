## Chef's Note
The secret to a "Gold Standard" vegan pasta salad is **Texture Integrity** through **The Layered Snap Pattern**. We use **Roasted Chickpeas** instead of croutons; their earthy, brittle crunch provides a necessary contrast to the soft "Bounce" of the rotini. We maintain the Silton Standard by dressing the hot pasta *before* adding the fresh greens; the residual heat of the noodle slightly absorbs the **Caesar Emulsion**, ensuring the flavor is locked into the starch. The avocado provides the final fatty **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water until **al dente**. Drain.
2.  **The Bind:** While the pasta is still warm, transfer to a large bowl and toss with 1/2 cup of the [Vegan Caesar Dressing](/recipes/vegan-caesar-dressing). Let stand for 5 minutes.
3.  **Combine:** Add the romaine, cherry tomatoes, and the remaining dressing. Toss gently with your hands (The Gold Standard).
4.  **The Snap:** Fold in the roasted chickpeas and the avocado slices just before serving. 
5.  **Serve:** Season generously with black pepper and sea salt. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
