## Chef's Note

Vegan Caesar dressings became mainstream in the 2010s, using cashews or tofu to replicate the creamy texture traditionally from anchovies and egg. Roasted chickpeas replace croutons for protein and crunch. The trick is dressing the warm pasta first—it absorbs more flavor than cold pasta would. Add the fresh romaine and avocado just before serving so they stay crisp and bright.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water until **al dente**. Drain.
2.  **The Bind:** While the pasta is still warm, transfer to a large bowl and toss with 1/2 cup of the Vegan Caesar Dressing. Let stand for 5 minutes.
3.  **Combine:** Add the romaine, cherry tomatoes, and the remaining dressing. Toss gently with your hands.
4.  **The Crunch:** Fold in the roasted chickpeas and the avocado slices just before serving.
5.  **Serve:** Season generously with black pepper and sea salt. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
