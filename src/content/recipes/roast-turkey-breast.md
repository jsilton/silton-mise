## Chef's Note

The secret to a holiday turkey breast that isn't dry is **Culinary Technique** through **The 155°F Carry-Over Method**. Most recipes bake until the bird reaches 165°F, which results in sawdust-dry meat. We pull the turkey at exactly 155°F; the residual energy will carry it to a safe 165°F during the mandatory **20-minute rest**, preserving the Texture and moisture of the protein. We maintain **Textural Balance** by using a rack to ensure the skin develops a uniform, golden Crunch all the way around.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 450°F. Place the turkey breast on a rack inside a roasting pan—this ensures air circulation for crispy skin.
2.  **Glaze:** Brush the skin generously with melted butter. Season aggressively with salt and pepper.
3.  **Sear:** Bake at 450°F for 15 minutes to kickstart the Crunch of the skin.
4.  **Baste:** Reduce heat to 350°F. Pour 1/2 cup stock into the pan. Roast for 45-60 minutes, basting every 20 minutes with the pan juices.
5.  **The Pull:** Use an instant-read thermometer. Remove the turkey when it hits **155°F** in the thickest part.
6.  **Rest:** Transfer to a carving board. Cover loosely with foil and **let rest for 20 minutes** (mandatory for moisture).
7.  **Serve:** Carve into 1/2-inch slices and serve with the pan drippings.
