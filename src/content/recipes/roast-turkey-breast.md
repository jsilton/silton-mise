## Chef's Note

Most recipes overcook turkey to 165°F, producing dry meat. Pulling the turkey at 155°F allows residual heat during the 20-minute rest to bring it to a safe 165°F, preserving moisture and tender texture. Roasting on a rack ensures air circulation around the bird, allowing the skin to develop a uniform, golden crisp all the way around instead of steaming on the bottom.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 450°F. Place the turkey breast on a rack inside a roasting pan—this ensures air circulation for crispy skin.
2.  **Glaze:** Brush the skin generously with melted butter. Season aggressively with salt and pepper.
3.  **Sear:** Bake at 450°F for 15 minutes to kickstart the Crunch of the skin.
4.  **Baste:** Reduce heat to 350°F. Pour 1/2 cup stock into the pan. Roast for 45-60 minutes, basting every 20 minutes with the pan juices.
5.  **The Pull:** Use an instant-read thermometer. Remove the turkey when it hits **155°F** in the thickest part.
6.  **Rest:** Transfer to a carving board. Cover loosely with foil and **let rest for 20 minutes** (mandatory for moisture).
7.  **Serve:** Carve into 1/2-inch slices and serve with the pan drippings.
