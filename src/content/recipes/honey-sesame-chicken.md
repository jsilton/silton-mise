## Chef's Note

Honey sesame chicken is a lighter take on Chinese-American takeout—no deep frying or heavy breading. Instead, sear chicken chunks over high heat to get crispy edges, then glaze them in a sauce that balances honey's sweetness with rice vinegar's sharpness. Toasted sesame seeds and green onions add finishing flavor and texture. Much healthier than the fried version but still intensely flavorful.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Toss chicken chunks with 1 tbsp soy sauce and the cornstarch.
2.  **Sear:** Heat a large skillet or wok over high heat with 2 tbsp oil. Add the chicken in a single layer. Let it sear undisturbed for 2-3 minutes until a golden crust forms. Flip and cook for 2 more minutes.
3.  **Aromatics:** Add the garlic and ginger to the pan. Sauté for 30 seconds.
4.  **Glaze:** Pour in the honey, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. Toss the chicken constantly for 1-2 minutes until the sauce bubbles and thickens into a glossy lacquer.
5.  **Finish:** Stir in the toasted sesame seeds and green onions.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately over [Jasmine Rice](/silton-mise/recipes/homemade-rice-pilaf).
