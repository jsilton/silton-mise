## Chef's Note

The secret to a "Gold Standard" Vongole is **Texture Integrity** through **The Cold Soak Pattern**. You must soak the clams in cold, salted water for 20 minutes before cooking; this encourages them to purge any internal sand, ensuring a clean "Snap" to the dish. We use **Dry Vermouth** instead of white wine to introduce a botanically rich "Deep Note" that pierces through the salty sea liquor. The 1-minute **Lid Shake Cycle** is mandatory to emulsify the oil and clam juices into a silky, translucent glaze.

## Directions

1.  **The Purge:** Soak clams in a bowl of cold salted water for 20 minutes. Drain and rinse.
2.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in a massive pot of salted water until **very al dente** (2 minutes less than directions).
3.  **Foundation:** In a large wide skillet, heat olive oil over medium. Sauté garlic and red pepper flakes for 1 minute until fragrant but not brown.
4.  **The Snap:** Add the vermouth and the clams. Cover tightly. **Shake the pan vigorously** for 2-3 minutes until all clams have popped open.
5.  **Bind:** Add the hot drained pasta directly to the skillet. Increase heat to medium-high.
6.  **Emulsify:** Toss vigorously for 1 minute until the pasta has absorbed the clam liquor and the oil has emulsified into a glossy film.
7.  **Finish:** Stir in the lemon juice and half the parsley.
8.  **Serve:** Garnish with the remaining parsley and a final drizzle of oil. Discard any clams that did not open.
