## Chef's Note

Spaghetti alle vongole is a classic from the Campania region (Naples and the Amalfi Coast), where fresh clams are abundant. In Italy, they use tiny vongole veraci that are sweet and delicate; American littleneck clams are larger but work beautifully. The dish is traditionally made in bianco (white, with garlic and oil) or in rosso (red, with tomatoes) - this is the white version. Soaking clams in cold salted water encourages them to purge sand. Vermouth adds botanical complexity that wine can't match, and the clam liquor released during steaming creates the sauce.

## Directions

1.  **The Purge:** Soak clams in a bowl of cold salted water for 20 minutes. Drain and rinse.
2.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in a massive pot of salted water until **very al dente** (2 minutes less than directions).
3.  **Foundation:** In a large wide skillet, heat olive oil over medium. Sauté garlic and red pepper flakes for 1 minute until fragrant but not brown.
4.  **The Crunch:** Add the vermouth and the clams. Cover tightly. **Shake the pan vigorously** for 2-3 minutes until all clams have popped open.
5.  **Bind:** Add the hot drained pasta directly to the skillet. Increase heat to medium-high.
6.  **Emulsify:** Toss vigorously for 1 minute until the pasta has absorbed the clam liquor and the oil has emulsified into a glossy film.
7.  **Finish:** Stir in the lemon juice and half the parsley.
8.  **Serve:** Garnish with the remaining parsley and a final drizzle of oil. Discard any clams that did not open.
