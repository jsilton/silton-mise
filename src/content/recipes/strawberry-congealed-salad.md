## Chef's Note

This is a **Modern Heritage** update to the definitive family gathering side. The secret to its Success is **The Sour Cream Layer Pattern**: instead of mixing everything together, we set half the fruit-jello mixture, spread a thick layer of sour cream, and then top with the remaining jello. This creates a multi-dimensional "Bounce" and a mandatory **Acid Finish** that cuts through the sweet fruit. We use **Mashed Bananas** as a structural binder, providing a dense, velvety consistency that standard gelatin lacks.

## Directions

1.  **Dissolve:** In a large bowl, whisk the Jello into the boiling water until no crystals remain.
2.  **Combine:** Stir in the thawed strawberries, drained pineapple, and mashed bananas. Fold in the pecans if using.
3.  **Stage 1:** Pour exactly half of the mixture into a 9x13 glass dish. **Refrigerate for 1-2 hours** until firm. Keep the remaining half at room temperature.
4.  **The Emulsion:** Once the first layer is set, spread the sour cream in an even layer over the top.
5.  **Stage 2:** Carefully pour the remaining Jello mixture over the sour cream.
6.  **Set:** Return to the fridge for **at least 2 more hours** (ideally 4) until completely congealed.
7.  **Serve:** Slice into squares and serve cold.
