## Chef's Note

This is an improved take on the definitive family gathering side. The secret is layering the sour cream: instead of mixing everything together, we set half the fruit-jello mixture, spread a thick layer of sour cream, and then top with the remaining jello. This creates distinct layers with contrasting textures and tangy richness that cuts through the sweet fruit. We use mashed bananas as a structural binder, providing a dense, velvety consistency that standard gelatin lacks.

## Directions

1.  **Dissolve:** In a large bowl, whisk the Jello into the boiling water until no crystals remain.
2.  **Combine:** Stir in the thawed strawberries, drained pineapple, and mashed bananas. Fold in the pecans if using.
3.  **Stage 1:** Pour exactly half of the mixture into a 9x13 glass dish. **Refrigerate for 1-2 hours** until firm. Keep the remaining half at room temperature.
4.  **The Emulsion:** Once the first layer is set, spread the sour cream in an even layer over the top.
5.  **Stage 2:** Carefully pour the remaining Jello mixture over the sour cream.
6.  **Set:** Return to the fridge for **at least 2 more hours** (ideally 4) until completely congealed.
7.  **Serve:** Slice into squares and serve cold.
