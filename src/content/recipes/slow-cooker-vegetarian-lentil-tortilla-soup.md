## Chef's Note

This Tex-Mex vegetarian tortilla soup uses red lentils that dissolve completely during slow-cooking, creating a naturally thick, protein-rich base that binds beans and corn together. A splash of heavy cream or sour cream stirred in at serving adds richness that balances the tart salsa verde. Lime juice brightens the finished soup.

## Directions

1.  **Combine:** Add all ingredients (except the cream and toppings) to a 6-quart slow cooker. Stir well to dissolve the tomato paste.
2.  **Cook:** Cover and cook on **High for 4-6 hours** (or Low for 8 hours) until the lentils have vanished and the soup is thick.
3.  **The Emulsion:** Stir in the optional heavy cream. For a smoother texture, use an immersion blender to pulse the soup 3-4 times—this keeps it chunky but increases the silkiness.
4.  **Finish:** Stir in the fresh lime juice. Season with salt and pepper.
5.  **Serve:** Ladle into bowls. Pile on the "Texture Stacks": crushed tortilla chips, diced avocado, and fresh cilantro.
