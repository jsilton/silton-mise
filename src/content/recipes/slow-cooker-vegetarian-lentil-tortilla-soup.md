## Chef's Note
The secret to a vegetarian tortilla soup that has "Main Dish" weight is **Structural Science** through **The Red Lentil Pattern**. As the red lentils slow-cook, they dissolve completely, creating a naturally thick, protein-rich "Bounce" that binds the black beans and corn together. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The Late-Cream Bind**: adding a splash of heavy cream (or sour cream) only at the moment of serving provides a rich, fatty "Snap" that balances the tart salsa verde. The lime juice provides the mandatory **Acid Finish**.

## Directions

1.  **Combine:** Add all ingredients (except the cream and toppings) to a 6-quart slow cooker. Stir well to dissolve the tomato paste.
2.  **Cook:** Cover and cook on **High for 4-6 hours** (or Low for 8 hours) until the lentils have vanished and the soup is thick.
3.  **The Emulsion:** Stir in the optional heavy cream. For the Gold Standard texture, use an immersion blender to pulse the soup 3-4 times—this keeps it chunky but increases the "silkiness."
4.  **Finish:** Stir in the fresh lime juice. Season with salt and pepper.
5.  **Serve:** Ladle into bowls. Pile on the "Texture Stacks": crushed tortilla chips, diced avocado, and fresh cilantro.
