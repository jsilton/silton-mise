## Chef's Note

This is a fresh dressing for summer salads. The key is letting the strawberries sit in the vinegar and honey for 30 minutes before blending. This draws out the natural juices through osmosis and creates a syrup that emulsifies perfectly with the olive oil. The result is a dressing with bright acidity that tastes like fresh fruit rather than a bottled version.

## Directions

1.  **Macerate:** In a small bowl, whisk together the balsamic vinegar and honey. Add the sliced strawberries and toss to coat. **Let stand for 30 minutes** at room temperature.
2.  **The Emulsion:** Transfer the strawberries and all their liquid into a blender or food processor.
3.  **Blend:** Add the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Pulse until completely smooth and vibrant red.
4.  **Adjust:** Taste and add a tiny splash more vinegar if you need a higher "High Note."
5.  **Serve:** Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 3 days. Shake vigorously before each use to restore the emulsion.
