## Chef's Note

This is a sophisticated quick drink that avoids the cloying artificiality of most frozen cocktails. We use **Culinary Technique** through **The Thermal Blender Method**: by using chilled fresh melon as the base, we reduce the amount of ice needed, ensuring the drink remains a potent, silky emulsion rather than a watery slush. The **Fresh Lime Juice** provides the mandatory **Acid Balance** that cuts through the honeyed notes of the Midori and the floral light rum.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Freeze your melon cubes for 30 minutes prior to starting for the Kitchen Standard texture.
2.  **Blend:** Combine the honeydew, light rum, lime juice, and melon liqueur in a high-powered blender.
3.  **Process:** Pulse on low, then increase to high until perfectly smooth. Add a handful of ice only if needed to reach a "thick-shake" consistency.
4.  **Skew:** Thread 3 cantaloupe cubes onto each sugar cane skewer.
5.  **Serve:** Pour into chilled coupes or martini glasses. Garnish with the skewers and serve immediately for the maximum "Bounce."
