## Chef's Note

This is a sophisticated frozen drink that avoids the cloying artificiality of most frozen cocktails. By using chilled fresh melon as the base, you reduce the amount of ice needed, ensuring the drink remains a potent, silky blend rather than a watery slush. The fresh lime juice provides essential acidity that cuts through the honeyed notes of the Midori and the floral light rum.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Freeze your melon cubes for 30 minutes prior to starting for the best texture.
2.  **Blend:** Combine the honeydew, light rum, lime juice, and melon liqueur in a high-powered blender.
3.  **Process:** Pulse on low, then increase to high until perfectly smooth. Add a handful of ice only if needed to reach a "thick-shake" consistency.
4.  **Skew:** Thread 3 cantaloupe cubes onto each sugar cane skewer.
5.  **Serve:** Pour into chilled coupes or martini glasses. Garnish with the skewers and serve immediately for the maximum "Bounce."
