## Chef's Note

The secret to "Restaurant Quality" garlic bread is **The Infusion**. Many recipes just rub raw garlic on bread, which can be bitter and sharp. We whisk the grated garlic and herbs into softened butter and spread it into every crevice of the loaf. Baking at a high temp (400°F) allows the garlic to "roast" inside the butter, creating a sweet, nutty aroma rather than a raw one.

## Directions

1.  **Butter:** In a small bowl, whisk the softened butter, garlic, parsley, Parmesan, and salt until it forms a cohesive paste.
2.  **Slice:** Slice the bread in half lengthwise (or into individual thick slices, leaving the bottom crust attached).
3.  **Spread:** Spread the garlic butter generously over the cut surfaces. **Don't be shy.**
4.  **Bake:** Place on a baking sheet. Bake at 400°F for 8-10 minutes until the edges are golden brown and the center is bubbly.
5.  **Finish:** For an extra-crunchy top, broil for the final 60 seconds. Slice and serve hot.
