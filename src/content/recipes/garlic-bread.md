## Chef's Note

Garlic bread as we know it is an Italian-American invention, popularized by steakhouses and Italian restaurants in the 1940s-50s. In Italy, bruschetta (grilled bread rubbed with raw garlic and drizzled with olive oil) is more traditional. The American version mixes minced garlic into softened butter with herbs and Parmesan, spreads it generously on bread, and bakes it at high heat. Baking at 400°F roasts the garlic inside the butter, mellowing its sharpness into a sweet, nutty flavor. Use a crusty Italian loaf or French baguette - soft sandwich bread won't work.

## Directions

1.  **Butter:** In a small bowl, whisk the softened butter, garlic, parsley, Parmesan, and salt until it forms a cohesive paste.
2.  **Slice:** Slice the bread in half lengthwise (or into individual thick slices, leaving the bottom crust attached).
3.  **Spread:** Spread the garlic butter generously over the cut surfaces. **Don't be shy.**
4.  **Bake:** Place on a baking sheet. Bake at 400°F for 8-10 minutes until the edges are golden brown and the center is bubbly.
5.  **Finish:** For an extra-crunchy top, broil for the final 60 seconds. Slice and serve hot.
