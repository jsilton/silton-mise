## Chef's Note

Warming olive oil and minced garlic in a small pan for exactly 1 minute "blooms" the garlic, removing its harsh sulfurous bite and creating a nutty, aromatic dressing for the steamed broccoli. Steaming for exactly 4 minutes ensures bright green color and tender-crisp texture—overcooking turns broccoli gray and mushy.

## Directions

1.  **Steam:** Add 1 inch of water to a saucepan and bring to a boil. Place broccoli in a steamer basket. Cover and steam for 4-5 minutes until bright green and tender-crisp.
2.  **Infuse:** In a small saucepan over medium-low, combine the oil and garlic. Heat for 60 seconds until the garlic is fragrant but not brown. Remove from heat immediately.
3.  **Drain:** Remove broccoli from the steamer and shake vigorously to remove all excess water.
4.  **Bind:** Transfer broccoli to a bowl. Drizzle with the garlic oil, salt, and pepper.
5.  **Toss:** Toss gently until every floret is glossy.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately as a clean, restorative side.
