## Description

A clean, simple preparation that highlights the freshness of the broccoli. Steaming preserves the vibrant green color and nutrients, while a quick toss in garlic-infused oil adds depth without the sharpness of citrus.

## Directions

1.  **Steam:** Add 1 inch of water to a saucepan and bring to a boil. Place broccoli florets in a steamer basket over the boiling water. Cover and steam for 4-5 minutes until tender-crisp and bright green.
2.  **Infuse:** While the broccoli steams, you can optionally warm the olive oil and garlic in a small pan for 1 minute to take the raw edge off the garlic, or simply use raw grated garlic for more bite.
3.  **Toss:** Remove the broccoli from the steamer and shake off excess water. Transfer to a bowl.
4.  **Finish:** Drizzle with olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Toss gently to coat and serve immediately.
