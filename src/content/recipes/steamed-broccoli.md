## Directions

1. How to steam broccoli? It's easy! Scroll down to the recipe card for detailed instructions. Here are the basic steps:
2. You start by placing the florets in a steamer basket. Steam them until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, quickly prepare the dressing by whisking together the remaining ingredients.
4. The final step is to toss the cooked broccoli florets with the dressing and serve.
5. EXPERT TIP
6. Timing this dish when it's part of a complete meal can be challenging. Sometimes I find that the broccoli is ready, but the rest of the meal isn't.
7. It's tempting to keep it warm by keeping it in the steaming basket, covered. But I think that's a mistake. It's better to enjoy crisp broccoli at room temperature than to suffer through mushy, limp, warm broccoli!
8. So as soon as the broccoli is ready, remove it onto a platter. Dress it with the olive oil-lemon dressing, loosely cover with foil, and serve when the rest of the meal is ready.
9. Unless you prefer broccoli with cheese sauce, in which case the broccoli should be the last thing you make. You want the cheese sauce warm and gooey.
10. How do you season broccoli?
11. Simple is best, in my opinion. I season this dish with olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. That's it! As long as the broccoli is nice and crisp, it's going to be delicious even with just a sprinkle of salt.
12. You can also use a little melted butter instead of olive oil. I've tried both versions and both are excellent.
13. Can I steam broccoli without a steamer?
14. The easiest way is to use your microwave and make microwave broccoli.
15. Another option is to place the broccoli directly in one inch of boiling water. It's not ideal, because the parts that are submerged in the water will actually boil. But it's probably better than completely submerging it in water.
16. RECOMMENDED MAIN DISHES
17. This is such a versatile side dish. It goes with anything, really. I often serve it with pork roast, with baked chicken breast, or with baked salmon. It's also good with a couple of fried eggs for a tasty and filling meatless dinner.
18. STORING LEFTOVERS
19. You can keep the leftovers in the fridge, in an airtight container, for 3-4 days. Reheat them gently, in the microwave on 50% power. They won't be as good as when served fresh, though. Sometimes I just add them cold to a salad.
20. Add 1 inch of water to a saucepan and bring to a boil.
21. Rinse the broccoli. Use a vegetable peeler to peel the stalks.
22. Cut the broccoli into bite-size florets and pieces, and place ina steamer basket.
23. Steam until tender-crisp. Start checking after 5 minutes. As soon as a fork can pierce the stalks, the broccoli is done. Even if the rest of the meal is not ready yet, remove the broccoli from the steamer onto a plate. Crisp steamed broccoli is delicious even at room temperature. Warm limp broccoli is not.
24. While the broccoli is steaming, in a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
25. Place the steamed broccoli in a bowl. Pour the dressing on top and gently mix. Serve immediately.

## Notes

If you don't own a steamer, the easiest way is to use your microwave and make microwave broccoli, which is essentially broccoli steamed in the microwave.Another option is to place the broccoli directly in one inch of boiling water. It's not ideal, because the parts that are submerged in the water will boil rather than steam. But it's probably better than completely submerging it in water.
