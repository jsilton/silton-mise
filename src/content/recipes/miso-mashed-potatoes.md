## Chef's Note

This is a **Palate Tuning** masterclass. We use white miso to provide a complex, savory "earthiness" that enhances the natural flavor of the potatoes. Yukon Golds are mandatory for their naturally buttery texture. The secret is to **Warm the Milk and Miso** together before adding to the potatoes—this ensures a silky emulsion that won't turn gummy.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Place potatoes in a pot of cold salted water. Bring to a boil and cook for 15-20 minutes until very tender.
2.  **Infuse:** While potatoes boil, whisk the milk, butter, and miso in a small pan over low heat until the miso is fully dissolved and the butter is melted.
3.  **Dry:** Drain the potatoes. Return them to the hot pot for 1 minute to "steam dry" (moisture is the enemy of creaminess).
4.  **Mash:** Mash the potatoes using a ricer (for restaurant-smooth) or a masher (for rustic).
5.  **Emulsify:** Gradually pour in the warm miso-milk mixture while stirring gently.
6.  **Serve:** Garnish with green onions.
