## Chef's Note

This is a "Modern Heritage" recipe designed for a baby's first birthday. It contains **No Refined Sugar**; we rely entirely on the natural fructose of over-ripe bananas and apple juice concentrate for sweetness. The secret to a successful smash cake is the **Oat Flour**: it provides a soft, "easy-to-smash" texture that is safer and more digestible for toddlers than a heavy dense cake.

## Directions

1.  **Batter:** Mash bananas until smooth. Whisk in applesauce, coconut oil, and vanilla. Fold in the flours, baking soda, and cinnamon.
2.  **Bake:** Pour into mini tart pans or a muffin tin. Bake at 375°F for 15-20 minutes until a tester comes out clean. Cool completely.
3.  **Frosting:** Whisk the softened cream cheese with the apple juice concentrate and vanilla until pale and fluffy.
4.  **Assemble:** Stack the mini rounds with a layer of frosting between them. "Frost" the entire outside.
5.  **Smash:** Serve to the birthday guest of honor.
