## Directions

1. Mash the bananas in a medium bowl.
2. In a separate large bowl, mix the flours, baking soda, and cinnamon together.
3. Add the mashed bananas, applesauce, coconut oil, and vanilla to the flour mixture. Mix just until incorporated.
4. Coat your 4 mini tart pans (these are the mini tart pans I use) + 6-8 muffin pans (or 2 8 or 9″round pans) with oil.
5. Spread the batter into the bottom of the pans.
6. Bake at 375° for 15-20 minutes. Check with a toothpick for doneness.
7. Cool the cakes before frosting. If you used the 8″ or 9″ pan, then use an overturned smaller bowl to cut out small cake rounds.
8. Soften the cream cheese.
9. Whisk the cream cheese with the apple juice concentrate and vanilla extract until creamy.
