## Chef's Note

This versatile Middle Eastern-inspired side dish gains its nutty complexity from toasting dry orzo in butter until deep mahogany brown. Turmeric provides the characteristic golden glow. Letting the rice steam with lid on after cooking ensures every grain stays distinct and resilient.

## Directions

1.  **Toasting:** In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add the orzo. Stir frequently for 3-4 minutes until the pasta is deep golden brown. Watch closely; it burns quickly.
2.  **The Grain:** Add the rice. Stir for 1 minute until the grains are coated in butter and look translucent at the edges.
3.  **Seasoning:** Stir in garlic powder, onion powder, and turmeric. Sauté for 30 seconds until the spices are fragrant.
4.  **Simmering:** Pour in the chicken broth. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil.
5.  **Cooking:** Reduce heat to low. Cover tightly with a lid. Simmer for 15-18 minutes until the liquid is fully absorbed.
6.  **Steaming:** Remove from heat. **Do not open the lid.** Let the rice steam for 10 minutes (essential for structure).
7.  **Finishing:** Remove lid, stir in dried parsley, and fluff with a fork.
