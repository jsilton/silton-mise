## Chef's Note

This is a versatile side dish that pairs with a wide variety of mains. The key to its flavor is **The Orzo Toasting Method**: toasting the dry orzo in butter until it reaches a deep "mahogany" brown develops the nutty complexity that defines the dish. Turmeric provides the characteristic golden glow. Letting the rice steam after cooking is essential for **Textural Balance**—it ensures every grain is distinct and has a resilient texture.

## Directions

1.  **Toasting:** In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add the orzo. Stir frequently for 3-4 minutes until the pasta is deep golden brown. Watch closely; it burns quickly.
2.  **The Grain:** Add the rice. Stir for 1 minute until the grains are coated in butter and look translucent at the edges.
3.  **Seasoning:** Stir in garlic powder, onion powder, and turmeric. Sauté for 30 seconds until the spices are fragrant.
4.  **Simmering:** Pour in the chicken broth. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil.
5.  **Cooking:** Reduce heat to low. Cover tightly with a lid. Simmer for 15-18 minutes until the liquid is fully absorbed.
6.  **Steaming:** Remove from heat. **Do not open the lid.** Let the rice steam for 10 minutes (essential for structure).
7.  **Finishing:** Remove lid, stir in dried parsley, and fluff with a fork.
