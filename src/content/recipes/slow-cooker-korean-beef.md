## Chef's Note

This slow-cooker version resembles Korean bulgogi and galbi, where soy-based marinades tenderize meat. Using beef chuck roast and cooking for 8 hours on low transforms tough connective tissue into succulent, melt-in-your-mouth beef. Whisking in a cornstarch slurry at the very end and increasing heat to High creates a thick, glossy glaze that clings to the beef cubes. Sriracha adds final heat that balances the sweet brown sugar.

## Directions

1.  **The Sauce:** In a large bowl, whisk together beef broth, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, sesame oil, vinegar, ginger, and Sriracha.
2.  **Slow Cook:** Place beef cubes in a 6-quart slow cooker. Pour the sauce over the top. **Cook on Low for 7-8 hours** until the beef is falling apart.
3.  **The Bind:** In a small jar, whisk cornstarch and 1/4 cup water. Stir into the pot.
4.  **Set:** Increase heat to **High**. Cook uncovered for 30 minutes until the sauce is thick and mirror-glossy.
5.  **Serve:** Garnish with fresh scallions and sesame seeds. Serve over steamed jasmine rice.
