## Chef's Note

The secret to "Street Quality" Korean beef in a slow cooker is **Structural Science** through **The Collagen Breakdown Pattern**. By using beef chuck roast and cooking it for a full 8 hours on low, we transform the tough connective tissue into a succulent, melt-in-your-mouth "Bounce." We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The 30-Minute Bind**: we whisk in a cornstarch slurry at the very end and increase the heat to "High"; this creates a thick, mahogany lacquer that clings to the beef cubes. The sriracha provides the final spicy **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **The Sauce:** In a large bowl, whisk together beef broth, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, sesame oil, vinegar, ginger, and Sriracha.
2.  **Slow Cook:** Place beef cubes in a 6-quart slow cooker. Pour the sauce over the top. **Cook on Low for 7-8 hours** until the beef is falling apart.
3.  **The Bind:** In a small jar, whisk cornstarch and 1/4 cup water. Stir into the pot.
4.  **Set:** Increase heat to **High**. Cook uncovered for 30 minutes until the sauce is thick and mirror-glossy.
5.  **Serve:** Garnish with fresh scallions and sesame seeds. Serve over steamed jasmine rice.
