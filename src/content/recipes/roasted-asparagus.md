## Chef's Note

Asparagus is 90% water. If you steam it or cook it at low heat, it turns gray and mushy. The secret to restaurant-quality asparagus is **High-Heat Roasting**: by using 425°F+, we evaporate the surface moisture instantly, resulting in bright green stalks with crispy, charred tips. Always finish with a squeeze of fresh lemon to provide the **Acid Balance**.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Pat the asparagus completely dry.
2.  **Toss:** On a large baking sheet, toss the stalks with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Arrange in a **single layer** (do not crowd, or they will steam).
3.  **Roast:** Bake for 8-12 minutes depending on the thickness of the stalks. They are done when they are tender-crisp and the tips are starting to brown.
4.  **Finish:** Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the hot stalks. Sprinkle with Parmesan or zest if using.
