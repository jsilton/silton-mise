## Chef's Note

Asparagus is 90% water. Steaming it or cooking at low heat turns it gray and mushy. Roasting at 425°F or higher evaporates surface moisture instantly, preserving bright green color and creating crispy, charred tips. A squeeze of fresh lemon at the end adds brightness that cuts through the roasted richness.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Pat the asparagus completely dry.
2.  **Toss:** On a large baking sheet, toss the stalks with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Arrange in a **single layer** (do not crowd, or they will steam).
3.  **Roast:** Bake for 8-12 minutes depending on the thickness of the stalks. They are done when they are tender-crisp and the tips are starting to brown.
4.  **Finish:** Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the hot stalks. Sprinkle with Parmesan or zest if using.
