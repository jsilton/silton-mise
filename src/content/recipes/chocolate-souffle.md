## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate test of **Culinary Technique**. The secret to a tall, even rise is the **Thumb-Run Method**: after filling the dish, you must run your thumb around the inside rim to create a small "channel." This prevents the batter from sticking to the edges, allowing it to rise straight up like a top hat. We use a **2:1 Ratio** of whites to yolks to ensure a light, airy Texture while maintaining deep chocolate intensity. Serve straight from the oven—the mandatory "High Note" is the fleeting moment before deflation.

## Directions

1.  **The Ladder:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Generously butter a 6-cup soufflé dish. Coat with 1 tbsp sugar, knocking out the excess.
2.  **The Base:** Melt chocolate in a heatproof bowl over simmering water. Stir until smooth. Remove from heat and whisk in the egg yolks—the mixture will stiffen, which is expected.
3.  **The Meringue:** In a clean bowl, beat egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form. Gradually add 1/3 cup sugar, beating until the whites are stiff and glossy.
4.  **The Lighten:** Stir about 1 cup of the meringue into the stiff chocolate base to loosen it.
5.  **The Fold:** Gently fold the remaining meringue into the chocolate using a "cut and fold" motion to preserve the air bubbles.
6.  **The Thumb-Run:** Spoon the batter into the dish. **Run your thumb** around the inside edge of the dish to create a shallow groove.
7.  **Bake:** Bake in the middle of the oven for 24-26 minutes until puffed and crusted on top but still having a slight "jiggle" in the center.
8.  **Serve:** Dust with powdered sugar and serve immediately with lightly sweetened whipped cream.
