## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate hack for families. The high-sugar soda contains phosphoric acid that breaks down the tough pork fibers in the **Pressure Cooker** 10x faster than a smoker. We finish the meat under the **Broiler** to get those "bark" edges that define restaurant BBQ. Make a double batch—this meat is the foundation for sandwiches, tacos, and baked potatoes.

## Directions

1.  **Rub:** Combine all rub ingredients. Massage into the pork chunks.
2.  **Sear (Optional but better):** Use the "Sauté" setting on your IP. Sear the pork chunks in oil until browned on all sides. Remove to a plate.
3.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the Dr. Pepper and vinegar. Scrape the bottom of the pot to release the fond.
4.  **Pressure:** Return the pork to the pot. Seal and cook on **HIGH PRESSURE** for 60 minutes.
5.  **Rest:** Let the pressure release naturally for 15 minutes.
6.  **Shred:** Remove pork to a tray and shred with two forks. Discard the excess liquid (or keep a little for moisture).
7.  **The Bark (Critical):** Toss the shredded pork with 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce. Spread on a baking sheet and **BROIL** for 5 minutes until the edges are crispy and charred.
8.  **Serve:** Toss with the remaining BBQ sauce.
