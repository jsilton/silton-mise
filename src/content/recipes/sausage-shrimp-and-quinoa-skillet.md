## Chef's Note

This 20-minute skillet uses pre-cooked quinoa (frozen or leftover) to speed up dinner. Frying the quinoa in rendered sausage fat for 2 minutes before adding shrimp toasts the grains and adds nutty flavor. Adding shrimp at the very end and cooking only until pink (about 3 minutes) keeps them tender and sweet rather than rubbery. The "holy trinity" of onion, pepper, and celery adds Cajun-Creole flavor to the dish.

## Directions

1.  **The Sear:** Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet. Add the chicken sausage and "Holy Trinity" veg. Sauté for 5-7 minutes over medium-high until the sausage is browned and the veg are soft.
2.  **The Grain:** Add the pre-cooked quinoa to the skillet. Stir vigorously for 2 minutes, allowing the grains to absorb the sausage fat and toast slightly.
3.  **Season:** Stir in the Creole seasoning.
4.  **The Crunch:** Add the shrimp. Cook for 2-3 minutes, tossing constantly, until the shrimp are pink and just opaque.
5.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
6.  **Serve:** Garnish with fresh parsley. Serve immediately.
