## Chef's Note
This is the ultimate 20-minute "Fuel" hero. The secret to quinoa that has a professional "Snap" is **The Sizzle Pattern**: we fry the pre-cooked grains in the rendered sausage fat for 2 minutes *before* adding the shrimp. This toasts the exterior of the quinoa, providing a nutty "Bounce." We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The 3-Minute Shrimp Standard**: we add the shrimp at the very end and cook only until they turn pink—this ensures they stay "Snappy" rather than rubbery.

## Directions

1.  **The Sear:** Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet. Add the chicken sausage and "Holy Trinity" veg. Sauté for 5-7 minutes over medium-high until the sausage is browned and the veg are soft.
2.  **The Grain:** Add the pre-cooked quinoa to the skillet. Stir vigorously for 2 minutes, allowing the grains to absorb the sausage fat and toast slightly.
3.  **Season:** Stir in the Creole seasoning. 
4.  **The Snap:** Add the shrimp. Cook for 2-3 minutes, tossing constantly, until the shrimp are pink and just opaque.
5.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
6.  **Serve:** Garnish with fresh parsley. Serve immediately.
