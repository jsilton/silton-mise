## Chef's Note

Created in 1920s Paris by American expat Erskine Gwynne, editor of a magazine called 'The Boulevardier,' this cocktail embodies the era of Americans living the high life in post-WWI Paris. It's essentially a whiskey Negroni, swapping gin for bourbon or rye, and was popular at Harry's New York Bar, the legendary watering hole of Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. The equal-parts ratio (1:1:1) is traditional, but many prefer more whiskey (1.5 or 2 oz) for a less bitter, more spirit-forward drink.
