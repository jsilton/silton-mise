Created in 1920s Paris by American expat Erskine Gwynne, the Boulevardier is essentially a whiskey Negroni. This sophisticated cocktail combines bourbon with Campari and sweet vermouth for a bold, bittersweet drink perfect for whiskey lovers.

## Ingredients

- 1.5 oz bourbon or rye whiskey
- 1 oz Campari
- 1 oz sweet vermouth
- Ice for stirring
- Orange peel for garnish

## Directions

1. Add the bourbon, Campari, and sweet vermouth to a mixing glass filled with ice.

2. Stir well for 20-30 seconds until properly chilled.

3. Strain into a chilled coupe glass or over a large ice cube in an Old Fashioned glass.

4. Express an orange peel over the drink and garnish.

5. Serve immediately.

## Chef's Note

The Boulevardier is a more robust, complex alternative to the Negroni, with whiskey providing depth and warmth that complements Campari's bitter notes. Use a good bourbon (like Buffalo Trace or Four Roses) or rye for more spice. The equal-parts ratio can be adjusted to taste - some prefer more whiskey (2:1:1) for a less bitter drink. This cocktail is excellent before dinner as an aperitif.
