## Chef's Note

This lighter pasta became popular in Italian-American cooking during the 1990s health-food movement. The clever trick: place raw spinach in a colander and drain the boiling pasta water directly over it. The hot water wilts the spinach perfectly while keeping it bright green. Sour cream instead of heavy cream adds tangy brightness that cuts through the rich, oily sun-dried tomatoes.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water according to package directions.
2.  **The Wilt:** Place raw spinach in a large colander. Pour the boiling pasta and its water directly over the spinach. Toss gently to wilt. Drain well.
3.  **The Base:** In the same pot, heat 1 tbsp of the tomato oil and the butter. Sauté onion and tomatoes for 3 minutes until soft. Add garlic and red pepper flakes; cook for 1 minute.
4.  **Simmer:** Pour in the broth. Simmer for 2 minutes until reduced by half.
5.  **Emulsify:** Whisk in the sour cream and Parmesan until a thick, creamy sauce forms.
6.  **Bind:** Return the spaghetti and spinach to the pot. Toss for 1 minute over low heat until the sauce is completely absorbed.
7.  **Serve:** Season with plenty of black pepper and serve hot.
