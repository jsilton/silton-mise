## Chef's Note

The secret to this nutritious pasta is **Textural Balance** through **The Colander Wilt Method**. Instead of sautéing the spinach, we place the raw leaves in a colander and drain the boiling pasta directly over them. This "thermal shock" ensures the spinach is just wilted and vibrant green rather than overcooked. We use **Sour Cream** instead of heavy cream to introduce a mandatory **Acid Balance** that cuts through the oily sun-dried tomatoes, resulting in a lighter Texture to the sauce.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water according to package directions.
2.  **The Wilt:** Place raw spinach in a large colander. Pour the boiling pasta and its water directly over the spinach. Toss gently to wilt. Drain well.
3.  **The Base:** In the same pot, heat 1 tbsp of the tomato oil and the butter. Sauté onion and tomatoes for 3 minutes until soft. Add garlic and red pepper flakes; cook for 1 minute.
4.  **Simmer:** Pour in the broth. Simmer for 2 minutes until reduced by half.
5.  **Emulsify:** Whisk in the sour cream and Parmesan until a thick, creamy sauce forms.
6.  **Bind:** Return the spaghetti and spinach to the pot. Toss for 1 minute over low heat until the sauce is completely absorbed.
7.  **Serve:** Season with plenty of black pepper and serve hot.
