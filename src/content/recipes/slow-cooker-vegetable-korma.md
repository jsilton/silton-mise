## Directions

1. In a large slow cooker/crock pot, add the chopped cauliflower, carrots, green peas, green beans, onion and garlic and mix well.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the coconut milk with the curry powder, sea salt, garam marsala and red pepper flakes and mix very well. Pour the liquid mixture over the vegetables evenly. Sprinkle with almond meal and ensure it is fully incorporated.
3. Cook on low for 8 hours or high for 5 hours, until the mixture is very thick. Serve immediately or allow to cool completely.

## Notes

What differs from a curry is that a korma is supposed to be more thick than liquid.As with any stew or curry, this tastes better the longer it sits.Refrigerate for up to one week or freeze for up to two months.
