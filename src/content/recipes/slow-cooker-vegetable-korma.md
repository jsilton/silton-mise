## Chef's Note

Korma is traditionally a thick, rich braise rather than a watery curry. Whisking almond meal into coconut milk introduces nutty starch that thickens the sauce and prevents it from separating during long slow-cooking. Using large cauliflower florets ensures they stay tender with some bite even after 5 hours in the crockpot, rather than dissolving into mush.

## Directions

1.  **The Pot:** In a 6-quart slow cooker, combine cauliflower, carrots, green beans, onion, and garlic.
2.  **The Sauce:** In a separate bowl, whisk coconut milk, curry powder, garam masala, salt, and almond meal until smooth.
3.  **Bind:** Pour the coconut emulsion over the vegetables. Toss until every floret is coated.
4.  **Cook:** Cover and cook on **High for 5 hours** (or Low for 8 hours) until the sauce is very thick and the vegetables are tender.
5.  **Finish:** Stir once more before serving. Taste and adjust salt if needed.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with warm naan or basmati rice.
