## Chef's Note

These breakfast cookies are ideal for busy mornings when you need portable nutrition. The secret to their incredible texture is using both rolled and quick-cooking oats, creating a cookie that's dense and chewy without crumbling. Coconut oil and honey serve as the primary binders and natural sweeteners. These cookies are intentionally designed not to spread; you must flatten them by hand before baking to achieve the desired shape.

## Directions

1.  **The Emulsion:** In a small bowl, whisk the melted coconut oil and honey until smooth. In a separate large bowl, whisk the eggs and pumpkin puree. Combine the two mixtures.
2.  **The Dry Mix:** In a massive bowl, toss together both types of oats, flaxseed, cranberries, pumpkin seeds, and spices.
3.  **Combine:** Pour the pumpkin emulsion over the dry ingredients. Stir vigorously until a thick, sticky dough forms.
4.  **Shape:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Scoop 1/4-cup portions of dough and **press down firmly** with your palm to create a 3/4-inch thick disk.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 15-20 minutes until the edges are golden brown and the center feels firm.
6.  **The Finish:** Let cool completely on the pan. This is mandatory for the flax and coconut oil to set the "Bounce."
