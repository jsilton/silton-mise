## Chef's Note

This modular grain bowl treats each component as an independent element. Marinating chicken thighs in oregano and lemon, then searing over high heat develops a charred, crispy crust characteristic of Greek souvlaki. Layering creamy hummus at the bowl's base prevents fresh cucumbers and tomatoes from becoming soggy. Pickled red onions provide bright acidity.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** In a large bowl, toss chicken thighs with olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, and garlic. **Let sit for at least 15 minutes** (ideally 2 hours).
2.  **The Sear:** Heat a large skillet or grill to medium-high. Cook chicken for 5-6 minutes per side until deeply charred and the internal temp is 165°F.
3.  **Rest:** Transfer to a board and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice into thin strips.
4.  **Assemble:** In four deep bowls, spread a generous base of hummus. Top with a scoop of warm rice or quinoa.
5.  **Layer:** Arrange the sliced chicken, cucumbers, and tomatoes in distinct "stacks" around the bowl.
6.  **Finish:** Top with crumbled feta and a massive pile of [Pickled Red Onions](/mise/recipes/pickled-red-onions). Serve with a lemon wedge for the final **High Note**.
