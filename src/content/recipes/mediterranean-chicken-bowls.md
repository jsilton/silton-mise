## Chef's Note

This is a masterclass in **Modularity**. Instead of a single dish, we treat this as a "Component Platter." The secret to the Kitchen Standard is **The Souvlaki Sear Method**: we marinate the chicken thighs in heavy oregano and lemon, then sear them over high heat to develop a charred, crispy crust. We maintain **Textural Balance** by layering the creamy hummus at the base to act as a "thermal guard" for the fresh cucumbers and tomatoes above. The mandatory **Acid Balance** comes from our [Pickled Red Onions](/silton-mise/recipes/pickled-red-onions).

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** In a large bowl, toss chicken thighs with olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, and garlic. **Let sit for at least 15 minutes** (ideally 2 hours).
2.  **The Sear:** Heat a large skillet or grill to medium-high. Cook chicken for 5-6 minutes per side until deeply charred and the internal temp is 165°F.
3.  **Rest:** Transfer to a board and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice into thin strips.
4.  **Assemble:** In four deep bowls, spread a generous base of hummus. Top with a scoop of warm rice or quinoa.
5.  **Layer:** Arrange the sliced chicken, cucumbers, and tomatoes in distinct "stacks" around the bowl.
6.  **Finish:** Top with crumbled feta and a massive pile of [Pickled Red Onions](/silton-mise/recipes/pickled-red-onions). Serve with a lemon wedge for the final **High Note**.
