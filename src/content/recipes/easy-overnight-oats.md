## Chef's Note

Overnight oats are the foundation of **Modularity** in our kitchen. The secret to the Kitchen Standard is the **8-Hour Hydration Method**: while 2 hours will work in a pinch, a full 8-hour soak allows the beta-glucans in the oats to fully emulsify with the yogurt and milk, creating a Texture that is creamy rather than chalky. We use **The Greek Yogurt Hack** to provide sustained nutritious and a thick, pudding-like consistency. Always add your Crunch ingredients (nuts, fresh fruit) just before eating to maintain **Textural Balance**.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a 16-oz mason jar or sealable container, combine oats, milk, yogurt, chia seeds, and sweetener.
2.  **Flavor Stack:** Stir in your chosen flavor ingredients (mashed banana, spices, nut butters).
3.  **Shake:** Seal the lid and shake vigorously for 10 seconds to ensure the chia seeds are evenly distributed.
4.  **The Long Set:** Refrigerate for **at least 8 hours** (overnight is best).
5.  **The Crunch:** In the morning, give it one final stir. Top with fresh berries, nuts, or granola just before serving.
6.  **Store:** These will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days—perfect for Batch Cooking.
