## Chef's Note

While 2 hours works in a pinch, an 8-hour soak allows oats' beta-glucans to fully emulsify with yogurt and milk, creating creamy rather than chalky texture. Greek yogurt adds protein and thick, pudding-like consistency. Add crunchy toppings (nuts, fresh fruit, granola) just before eating. These keep refrigerated for up to 5 days.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a 16-oz mason jar or sealable container, combine oats, milk, yogurt, chia seeds, and sweetener.
2.  **Flavor Stack:** Stir in your chosen flavor ingredients (mashed banana, spices, nut butters).
3.  **Shake:** Seal the lid and shake vigorously for 10 seconds to ensure the chia seeds are evenly distributed.
4.  **The Long Set:** Refrigerate for **at least 8 hours** (overnight is best).
5.  **The Crunch:** In the morning, give it one final stir. Top with fresh berries, nuts, or granola just before serving.
6.  **Store:** These will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days—perfect for Batch Cooking.
