## Chef's Note

The secret to extraordinary texture is chilling the dough for 24 hours. Refrigerating the dough overnight is mandatory; it allows the starch to fully hydrate and the sugars to undergo enzymatic breakdown, resulting in a cookie with deep, butterscotch-like flavor. We use dark brown sugar instead of light to provide a richer moisture profile and a more pronounced chewy center. This recipe uses a generous chocolate ratio—4.5 cups ensure that every single bite is dominated by molten chocolate.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** Whisk together flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Set aside.
2.  **Cream:** In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream butter and both sugars on medium speed for exactly 4 minutes until pale and aerated. Add eggs one at a time, followed by vanilla.
3.  **Combine:** On low speed, add the flour mixture until **just combined**. Fold in the chocolate chips by hand to avoid breaking them.
4.  **The Chill:** Press plastic wrap against the surface of the dough and refrigerate for **at least 24 hours** (ideally 36).
5.  **Portion:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Using a 2 1/4-inch scoop, drop dough balls onto parchment-lined sheets, 3 inches apart.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 15-17 minutes until the edges are golden brown and the centers are set but still look soft.
7.  **Cool:** Let sit on the sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.
