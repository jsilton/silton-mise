## Chef's Note

This is the baseline for high-speed "Fuel" desserts. The secret to a professional-grade fruit ice cream without eggs is **The Acid Stabilizer Pattern**: we use a full 4 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice; the acid reacts with the proteins in the heavy cream to create a thick, stable emulsion with a "Bounce" that mimics custard. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The Puree Standard**: by pulverizing the strawberries before churning, we ensure the flavor is evenly distributed and avoid the "icy chunk" problem of whole fruit.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a massive bowl (or blender), combine the milk, cream, sugar, salt, and vanilla. Whisk until the sugar is fully dissolved.
2.  **The Fruit:** Stir in the strawberry puree and the lemon juice. Whisk vigorously for 1 minute—you will see the mixture begin to thicken.
3.  **Churn:** Pour the mixture into the freezer bowl of your ice cream maker.
4.  **Process:** Churn according to manufacturer's instructions (usually 20-25 minutes) until it reaches soft-serve consistency.
5.  **Set:** For the Gold Standard texture, freeze for 2 hours before scooping.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with a "High Note" of fresh mint.
