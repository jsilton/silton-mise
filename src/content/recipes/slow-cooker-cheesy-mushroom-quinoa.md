## Chef's Note

Using a strict 1:2 ratio of quinoa to liquid and cooking on High for a shorter duration (2-3 hours instead of 4-5) ensures each grain maintains its texture and distinct curly tail rather than turning to porridge. Adding cream cheese cubes at the very end creates risotto-like silkiness that standard shredded cheese cannot achieve—the residual heat melts it into a smooth, creamy sauce.

## Directions

1.  **Combine:** Add quinoa, mushrooms, broth, red pepper, garlic, and herbs to the slow cooker. Stir well.
2.  **Cook:** Cover and cook on **High for 2-3 hours** (or Low for 4-5 hours) until the liquid is fully absorbed.
3.  **Emulsify:** Open the lid. Add the cream cheese cubes. Stir vigorously for 1 minute until the cream cheese has melted and emulsified with the grain.
4.  **Bind:** Top with the Italian cheese blend. Cover and cook for another 15 minutes until molten.
5.  **Finish:** Stir once more. Garnish with fresh green onions for the mandatory **High Note**.
