## Chef's Note

The secret to slow-cooker quinoa that isn't a soggy porridge is **Structural Science** through **The Absorption Pattern**. We use a strict 1:2 ratio of grain to liquid and cook on "High" for a shorter duration; this ensures each grain of quinoa maintains its "Snap" and distinct curly tail. The addition of **Cream Cheese** at the very end provides the mandatory "Bounce," creating a risotto-like silkiness that standard shredded cheese cannot achieve.

## Directions

1.  **Combine:** Add quinoa, mushrooms, broth, red pepper, garlic, and herbs to the slow cooker. Stir well.
2.  **Cook:** Cover and cook on **High for 2-3 hours** (or Low for 4-5 hours) until the liquid is fully absorbed.
3.  **Emulsify:** Open the lid. Add the cream cheese cubes. Stir vigorously for 1 minute until the cream cheese has melted and emulsified with the grain.
4.  **Bind:** Top with the Italian cheese blend. Cover and cook for another 15 minutes until molten.
5.  **Finish:** Stir once more. Garnish with fresh green onions for the mandatory **High Note**.
