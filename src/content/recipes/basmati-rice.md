## Chef's Note

Perfect Basmati rice is an exercise in **Surface Area Management**. The secret is the **Triple Rinse**: you must wash the rice in a bowl until the water runs clear. This removes the surface starch that causes rice to turn into a sticky, gummy clump. By rinsing and then steaming with the lid on, you get individual, distinct grains that are light and airy.

## Directions

1.  **The Rinse:** Place rice in a bowl. Cover with water, swirl with your hand, and drain. Repeat 3-4 times until the water is no longer cloudy.
2.  **Combine:** Put the rinsed rice in a rice cooker or heavy pot. Add 3 cups of fresh water, butter, salt, and cumin.
3.  **Cook:** Set rice cooker to "White Rice" or simmer on low for 15-18 minutes if using a pot.
4.  **The Rest (Critical):** Once cooked, **do not open the lid.** Let the rice steam for 10 minutes. This allows the moisture to redistribute into the center of each grain.
5.  **Fluff:** Gently fluff with a fork and serve.
