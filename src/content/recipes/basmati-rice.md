A fail-proof method for fluffy, non-sticky Basmati rice using a rice cooker. Includes the wash technique essential for distinct grains.

## Directions

1. Wash: Place rice in the rice cooker bowl. Fill with water, swirl with your hand, and drain cloudy water. Repeat 3–4 times until the water runs clear. Drain fully.
2. Combine: Add the 3 cups of fresh water, butter, salt, and cumin seeds to the washed rice.
3. Cook: Set rice cooker to "White Rice" or standard cook setting.
4. Rest & Fluff: When the cooker finishes, let it sit on "Warm" for 5 minutes (do not open immediately). Open lid and gently fluff with a fork to release steam.

## Notes

Washing the rice removes surface starch and prevents the rice from becoming a sticky clump.The 1:1.5 ratio (1 cup rice to 1.5 cups water) is ideal for most standard rice cookers.
