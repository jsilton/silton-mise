## Chef's Note

This is the "Gold Standard" for a high-performance "Fuel" smoothie. The secret to its elite flavor is **The "Trust Me" Salt Pinch**: a tiny amount of salt suppresses the bitterness of the raw spinach while amplifying the tropical sweetness of the mango. We use **The Thermal Blender Pattern**: by using frozen fruit as our "ice," we maintain a thick, creamy "Bounce" without diluting the nutrients. The lime juice provides the mandatory **Acid Finish** that keeps the drink refreshing rather than heavy.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a high-powered blender, combine the spinach, coconut water, and orange. Blend on high for 30 seconds until the greens are completely pulverized.
2.  **The Bulk:** Add the frozen mango, frozen pineapple, lime juice, and the pinch of sea salt.
3.  **Process:** Blend on high for 60 seconds until perfectly velvety.
4.  **Adjust:** If the smoothie is too thick, add a splash more coconut water. If you want more "Snap," add extra lime juice.
5.  **Serve:** Pour into two chilled glasses. Garnish with a lime slice and serve immediately.
