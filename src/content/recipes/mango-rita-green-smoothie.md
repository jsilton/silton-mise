## Chef's Note

This is a nutritious green smoothie. The secret to its flavor is a tiny pinch of salt: it suppresses the bitterness of the raw spinach while amplifying the tropical sweetness of the mango. By using frozen fruit as our ice, we maintain a thick, creamy texture without diluting the nutrients. The lime juice keeps the drink refreshing rather than heavy.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a high-powered blender, combine the spinach, coconut water, and orange. Blend on high for 30 seconds until the greens are completely pulverized.
2.  **The Bulk:** Add the frozen mango, frozen pineapple, lime juice, and the pinch of sea salt.
3.  **Process:** Blend on high for 60 seconds until perfectly velvety.
4.  **Adjust:** If the smoothie is too thick, add a splash more coconut water. If you want more "Snap," add extra lime juice.
5.  **Serve:** Pour into two chilled glasses. Garnish with a lime slice and serve immediately.
