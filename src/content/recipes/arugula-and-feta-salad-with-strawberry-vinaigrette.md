## Chef's Note

This salad is a masterclass in the **Acid Balance**. The sweetness of the strawberries and the richness of the feta need the peppery bite of arugula and the sharp acid of the vinaigrette to balance the plate. We use a **Pureed Base** for the dressing to ensure every leaf is coated in fruit flavor rather than just oil.

## Directions

1.  **The Dressing:** In a small blender or using an immersion blender, puree 4 strawberries with the olive oil, vinegar, honey, and garlic until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
2.  **Prep:** Place arugula in a large bowl. Toss with half the dressing until lightly glossy.
3.  **Layer:** Add the sliced strawberries, feta, and sunflower seeds.
4.  **Finish:** Drizzle the remaining dressing over the top. Serve immediately.
