## Chef's Note

Peppery arugula cuts through sweet strawberries and tangy feta, with sunflower seeds adding crunch. Pureeing fresh strawberries into the vinaigrette ensures every leaf gets coated with fruit flavor instead of just oil. This Mediterranean-inspired combination works best with peak-season berries.

## Directions

1.  **The Dressing:** In a small blender or using an immersion blender, puree 4 strawberries with the olive oil, vinegar, honey, and garlic until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
2.  **Prep:** Place arugula in a large bowl. Toss with half the dressing until lightly glossy.
3.  **Layer:** Add the sliced strawberries, feta, and sunflower seeds.
4.  **Finish:** Drizzle the remaining dressing over the top. Serve immediately.
