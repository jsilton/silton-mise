## Chef's Note

This is a **Updated Classic** update to a classic family "Congealed Salad." The secret to the Kitchen Standard is **The Sour Cream Emulsion**: we whisk the sour cream into the hot Jello base until perfectly smooth. This transforms a translucent gelatin into a creamy, opaque mousse with a sophisticated "Bounce." We maintain **Textural Balance** by using crushed pineapple _with_ its rice-like particles, which provides a necessary Crunch to contrast the velvety base.

## Directions

1.  **Dissolve:** In a large bowl, whisk the Orange Jello and sugar into the boiling water until no crystals remain.
2.  **Emulsify:** Add the sour cream to the hot liquid. Whisk vigorously until the mixture is completely smooth and pale orange.
3.  **Texture:** Fold in the crushed pineapple (with its juice) and the drained mandarin oranges.
4.  **The Finish:** Pour the mixture into a glass bowl or a decorative mold.
5.  **Chill:** Refrigerate for **at least 4 hours** (ideally overnight) until perfectly congealed and firm.
6.  **Serve:** Serve chilled as a bright side dish or a light dessert.
