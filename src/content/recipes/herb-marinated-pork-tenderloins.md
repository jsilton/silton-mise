## Chef's Note

This is the "Gold Standard" for a 25-minute weeknight main. The secret to its elite juiciness is **Structural Science** through **The 137°F Standard**. Most recipes overcook pork to 160°F; we sear the meat to develop a Maillard crust and then roast until it hits 137°F. The residual heat during the mandatory **10-Minute Rest** will bring it to a perfect 145°F, resulting in a succulent, blush-pink "Bounce." The lemon and Dijon provide the mandatory **Acid Finish** that cuts through the rich pork fat.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** Combine lemon juice, zest, olive oil, garlic, herbs, mustard, and 2 tsp salt in a large sealable bag. Add pork and toss to coat. **Marinate for at least 3 hours** (ideally overnight) to allow the enzymes to tenderize the meat.
2.  **The Sear:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Remove pork from marinade (discard liquid). Season aggressively with salt and pepper. Heat 3 tbsp oil in a large oven-proof skillet over medium-high. Sear pork on all sides until deep golden brown.
3.  **Roast:** Transfer the skillet directly to the oven. Roast for 10-15 minutes until the internal temperature reaches **137°F** at the thickest part.
4.  **The Set:** Remove to a platter and cover tightly with foil. **Rest for 10 minutes**—this is mandatory for the juices to redistribute.
5.  **Serve:** Carve into 1/2-inch thick diagonal slices. Serve warm with the accumulated juices from the platter.
