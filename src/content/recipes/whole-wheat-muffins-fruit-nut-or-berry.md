## Chef's Note

These are whole-wheat breakfast muffins. The key to a muffin that isn't heavy is using apple or orange juice as the primary liquid. This provides natural sweetness and acidity that ensures the whole-wheat flour fully hydrates without becoming dense. Instead of folding the fruit into the batter, sprinkle it over the raw muffins in the pan—this prevents the berries from bleeding and ensures a crispy golden top.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a separate bowl, whisk eggs, honey, vanilla, oil, and juice until smooth.
3.  **Combine:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Stir with a spatula for exactly 15-20 seconds until **just combined**. **Do not over-mix.**
4.  **Portion:** Line a 12-cup muffin tin. Fill each cup 2/3 full.
5.  **The Crunch:** Sprinkle your choice of fruit (blueberries, diced pears, etc.) onto the top of each raw muffin. Stir gently with a toothpick to submerge.
6.  **Bake:** Preheat oven to 400°F (high heat for Crunch vertical rise). Bake for 10-15 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean.
7.  **Serve:** Best served warm with salted butter.
