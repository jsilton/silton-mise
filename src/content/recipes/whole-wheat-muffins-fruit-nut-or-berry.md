## Chef's Note
These are the definitive Silton **Modularity** components for breakfast. The secret to a whole-wheat muffin with a "Bounce" is **The Fruit Juice Hydration Pattern**. By using apple or orange juice as the primary liquid, we provide natural fructose and an **Acid Finish** that ensures the whole-wheat starch fully hydrates without becoming leaden. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The Top-Mix Method**: instead of folding the fruit into the batter, we sprinkle it over the raw muffins in the pan—this prevents the berries from bleeding and ensures a "Snappy" golden top.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a separate bowl, whisk eggs, honey, vanilla, oil, and juice until smooth.
3.  **Combine:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Stir with a spatula for exactly 15-20 seconds until **just combined**. **Do not over-mix.**
4.  **Portion:** Line a 12-cup muffin tin. Fill each cup 2/3 full. 
5.  **The Snap:** Sprinkle your choice of fruit (blueberries, diced pears, etc.) onto the top of each raw muffin. Stir gently with a toothpick to submerge.
6.  **Bake:** Preheat oven to 400°F (high heat for "Snap" vertical rise). Bake for 10-15 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean.
7.  **Serve:** Best served warm with salted butter.
