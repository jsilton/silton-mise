## Chef's Note

Shakshuka is about the **Jammy Base**. Many recipes are watery; the secret is to sauté the peppers and onions until they are completely soft and starting to caramelize before adding the tomatoes. We serve this **over a bed of Hummus** instead of heavy bread to keep it high-protein and fuel-focused.

## Directions

1.  **Sauté:** Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add peppers and onions. Cook for 10-12 minutes until very soft.
2.  **Bloom:** Add garlic, tomato paste, cumin, paprika, and cayenne. Stir for 2 minutes until the paste is dark and fragrant.
3.  **Simmer:** Add the crushed tomatoes and their juices. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes until the sauce is thick and jammy. Season with salt and pepper.
4.  **Poach:** Use a spoon to make 4 small wells in the sauce. Crack an egg into each well. Cover the skillet.
5.  **Set:** Cook for 5-8 minutes until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still runny.
6.  **Assemble:** Smear 2 tbsp of hummus on the bottom of each plate. Carefully ladle the sauce and an egg over the hummus.
7.  **Finish:** Garnish with feta and cilantro.
