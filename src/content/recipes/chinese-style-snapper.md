## Chef's Note

Cooking a whole fish is the ultimate expression of **Modern Heritage**. To ensure **Texture Integrity**, we use the **Triple Slash Pattern**: cutting three deep slits into the thickest part of the fish. This allows the heat and the seasoning sauce to penetrate the core, preventing the outside from overcooking before the middle is done. We finish with the **Smoking Oil Method**, pouring just-smoking peanut oil over fresh scallions to release their aromatic essence directly into the skin.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a roasting pan with foil and then parchment paper.
2.  **Slash:** Rinse the snapper and pat **extremely dry**. Cut 3 slashes (1cm deep) into each side of the fish. Place in the prepared pan.
3.  **Season:** Spread half the ginger and garlic into the slits. Whisk soy sauce, broth, rice wine, and sesame oil; pour over the fish.
4.  **Bake:** Cover the pan tightly with foil to create a steam chamber. Bake for 45-50 minutes until the flesh flakes easily with a fork.
5.  **Garnish Prep:** Carefully transfer the fish to a warm platter. Reserve the juices from the pan. Pile the scallions and the remaining ginger on top of the fish.
6.  **The Sizzle:** Heat peanut oil in a small saucepan until just smoking. Carefully pour it over the scallion/ginger pile—it should sizzle loudly.
7.  **Finish:** Pour the reserved pan juices over the fish. Garnish with cilantro and serve immediately.
