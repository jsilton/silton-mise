## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 220°C. Line a roasting pan with foil, then with non-stick baking paper.
2. Wash the snapper under cold running water. Pat dry with paper towel inside and out. Cut 3 slashes, about 1cm deep, in the thickest part of snapper on both sides. Place in the lined pan.
3. Spread garlic and ginger over the snapper. Combine soy sauce, chicken stock, Chinese rice wine or dry sherry and sesame oil in a jug. Pour over the snapper. Cover the pan tightly with foil. Bake for 45-50 minutes or until snapper flakes easily when tested with a fork. Transfer to a warmed heatproof platter, reserving juices.
4. Heat peanut oil in saucepan over medium heat until just smoking. Pour over snapper. Pour over the reserved juices. Top with shallot and coriander to serve.
