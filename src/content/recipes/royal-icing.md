## Chef's Note

Royal icing is the traditional coating for decorated sugar cookies, gingerbread houses, and wedding cakes because it dries to a hard, glossy finish. Beating egg whites on low speed until frothy before adding sugar breaks down protein chains without creating large air bubbles, producing smooth icing that doesn't crack. Use thick icing for borders; thin it with water to "15-second consistency" (where a ribbon of icing disappears back into the bowl in 15 seconds) for flooding centers.

## Directions

1.  **Froth:** In a stand mixer, beat egg whites on medium-low for 1 minute until bubbly but not peaking.
2.  **Incorporate:** Switch to low speed. Slowly add the sifted sugar and vanilla.
3.  **Emulsify:** Once combined, increase speed to medium-high. Beat for 2-3 minutes until the icing is stiff, glossy, and holds a Crunch peak.
4.  **Dye:** Divide into small bowls. Stir in gel food coloring (The Finishing Touch).
5.  **Consistency:** For flooding, add water 1/2 tsp at a time until a ribbon of icing disappears back into the bowl in exactly 15 seconds.
6.  **Store:** Keep bowls tightly covered with plastic wrap—this icing sets instantly when exposed to air.
