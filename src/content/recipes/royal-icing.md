## Chef's Note

The secret to a "Kitchen Standard" royal icing is **Culinary Technique** through **The Low-Speed Aeration Method**. You must beat the egg whites on low speed until frothy _before_ adding the sugar; this breaks down the protein chains without introducing large air bubbles, resulting in a glass-smooth Crunch finish that doesn't crack. We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Flood & Outline Method**: use the icing thick for borders and add a drop of water for a "15-second consistency" to flood the centers for a mirror-glossy look.

## Directions

1.  **Froth:** In a stand mixer, beat egg whites on medium-low for 1 minute until bubbly but not peaking.
2.  **Incorporate:** Switch to low speed. Slowly add the sifted sugar and vanilla.
3.  **Emulsify:** Once combined, increase speed to medium-high. Beat for 2-3 minutes until the icing is stiff, glossy, and holds a Crunch peak.
4.  **Dye:** Divide into small bowls. Stir in gel food coloring (The Finishing Touch).
5.  **Consistency:** For flooding, add water 1/2 tsp at a time until a ribbon of icing disappears back into the bowl in exactly 15 seconds.
6.  **Store:** Keep bowls tightly covered with plastic wrap—this icing sets instantly when exposed to air.
