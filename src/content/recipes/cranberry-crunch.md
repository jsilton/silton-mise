## Chef's Note

This family crisp uses butter instead of margarine for a richer oat topping. Tart Granny Smith apples and fresh cranberries cut through the buttery sweetness naturally. Bake until fruit juices bubble around the edges - this indicates the sugar has emulsified with the fruit's natural pectin.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter or oil spray.
2.  **Fruit Base:** Arrange the sliced apples and cranberries in the bottom of the dish. Sprinkle the granulated sugar evenly over the fruit and toss gently to coat.
3.  **Topping:** In a medium bowl, combine oats, brown sugar, flour, and chopped pecans. Pour the melted butter over the mix and stir until it looks like wet sand.
4.  **Layer:** Spread the topping evenly over the fruit. Press down lightly to ensure it adheres to the sugar-coated fruit.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 45-60 minutes until the fruit is tender and bubbling and the topping is a deep golden brown.
6.  **Cool:** Let cool for 10 minutes before serving. This allows the fruit juices to thicken into a glossy syrup.
