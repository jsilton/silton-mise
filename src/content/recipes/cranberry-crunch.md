## Chef's Note
This is a **Modern Heritage** update to a classic family crisp. We have replaced the legacy margarine with **Unsalted Butter** to provide a richer, more nuanced "Snap" to the oat topping. The secret to the Silton Standard here is **The Acid Finish**: the combination of tart Granny Smith apples and fresh whole cranberries provides a natural "High Note" that cuts through the buttery topping. Always bake until the fruit juices are bubbling up around the edges—this indicates the sugar has fully emulsified with the fruit pectin.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter or oil spray.
2.  **Fruit Base:** Arrange the sliced apples and cranberries in the bottom of the dish. Sprinkle the granulated sugar evenly over the fruit and toss gently to coat.
3.  **Topping:** In a medium bowl, combine oats, brown sugar, flour, and chopped pecans. Pour the melted butter over the mix and stir until it looks like wet sand.
4.  **Layer:** Spread the topping evenly over the fruit. Press down lightly to ensure it adheres to the sugar-coated fruit.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 45-60 minutes until the fruit is tender and bubbling and the topping is a deep golden brown.
6.  **Cool:** Let cool for 10 minutes before serving. This allows the fruit juices to thicken into a glossy syrup.
