## Chef's Note

This is the definitive Boston-Chinese "Heritage" standard. The name is literal: the sauce is designed _for_ lobster, though we use shrimp here. The secret to its Success is **Culinary Technique** through **The Egg Ribbon Method**: you must turn off the heat and slowly drizzle the beaten egg into the boiling sauce while stirring gently; this creates silken ribbons that provide a velvety "Bounce." We use **Fermented Black Beans** as the complex flavor to provide the earthy backbone that defines the dish.

## Directions

1.  **The Render:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok. Brown the ground pork until crispy (5 mins).
2.  **Aromatics:** Add the garlic and mashed black beans. Sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.
3.  **The Crunch:** Add the shrimp. Stir-fry for 2 minutes over high heat until just pink.
4.  **Simmer:** Pour in the chicken stock and soy sauces. Bring to a rapid boil.
5.  **Bind:** Stir in the cornstarch slurry. Simmer for 1 minute until the sauce is thick and glossy.
6.  **The Ribbon:** Turn off the heat. Drizzle the egg in a thin stream, stirring once or twice. Let stand for 30 seconds to set the "Bounce."
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with green onions. Serve immediately over white rice.
