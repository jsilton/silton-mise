## Chef's Note

Lobster sauce is a Chinese-American invention from the mid-20th century, originally designed to accompany whole lobster but now commonly served with shrimp. The sauce gets its distinctive character from fermented black beans (douchi) and silky egg ribbons created by drizzling beaten egg into the hot sauce off-heat, a Cantonese technique that adds body and richness.

## Directions

1.  **The Render:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok. Brown the ground pork until crispy (5 mins).
2.  **Aromatics:** Add the garlic and mashed black beans. Sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.
3.  **The Crunch:** Add the shrimp. Stir-fry for 2 minutes over high heat until just pink.
4.  **Simmer:** Pour in the chicken stock and soy sauces. Bring to a rapid boil.
5.  **Bind:** Stir in the cornstarch slurry. Simmer for 1 minute until the sauce is thick and glossy.
6.  **The Ribbon:** Turn off the heat. Drizzle the egg in a thin stream, stirring once or twice. Let stand for 30 seconds to set the "Bounce."
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with green onions. Serve immediately over white rice.
