## Description

A classic Boston-Chinese favorite (think Golden Temple). Despite the name, there is no lobster. It's a savory ground pork and black bean sauce finished with egg ribbons.

## Directions

1.  Heat oil in a wok or skillet over high heat. Stir-fry the ground pork until browned.
2.  Add the garlic and mashed black beans. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
3.  Add the shrimp and stir-fry for 2 minutes until pink.
4.  Pour in the chicken stock, soy sauce, and dark soy sauce (or molasses). Bring to a boil.
5.  Stir in the cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce.
6.  **The Egg Ribbon:** Turn off the heat. Slowly drizzle in the beaten egg while stirring gently to create silky ribbons.
7.  Garnish with green onions.
