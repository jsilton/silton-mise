## Chef's Note

Great coconut rice should be rich, fragrant, and slightly sticky. We use a **50/50 Ratio** of coconut milk to water to ensure the rice is deeply infused with fat without being heavy or greasy. The secret is the **Resting Period**: by leaving the lid on for 10 minutes after the heat is off, the rice finish absorbing the steam, resulting in a perfectly tender grain.

## Directions

1.  **Rinse:** Rinse the jasmine rice in a bowl until the water runs clear. Drain well.
2.  **Boil:** In a saucepan, combine the coconut milk, water, sugar, and salt. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat.
3.  **Simmer:** Stir in the rice. Cover tightly with a lid and reduce heat to the lowest setting. Simmer for 18-20 minutes until the liquid is absorbed.
4.  **Steam:** **Turn off the heat.** Keep the lid on and let the rice steam for 10-15 minutes.
5.  **Serve:** Fluff gently with a fork and serve hot.
