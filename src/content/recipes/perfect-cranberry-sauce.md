## Chef's Note

This is classic cranberry sauce for the holiday table. The technique is to cook 3/4 of the cranberries until they burst and release their pectin, then stir in the remaining whole berries at the very end. This ensures the sauce has a thick, jammy texture while maintaining the crunch of whole fruit. The orange zest balances the tart berries and sweet sugar.

## Directions

1.  **Reserve:** Measure the berries. Set aside 1/2 cup of the best-looking whole cranberries.
2.  **Dissolve:** In a medium saucepan, combine the remaining cranberries, sugar, orange zest, and water.
3.  **Simmer:** Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes until the sugar dissolves and the berries begin to soften.
4.  **The Burst:** Increase heat to medium. Cook for 10-12 minutes until the berries pop and the liquid transforms into a thick, glossy syrup.
5.  **Texture:** Remove from heat. Immediately stir in the **Reserved Whole Cranberries**.
6.  **Set:** Season with a pinch of salt. Let cool completely to room temperature—the sauce will continue to thicken into a Texture as it cools.
7.  **Store:** Keeps in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
