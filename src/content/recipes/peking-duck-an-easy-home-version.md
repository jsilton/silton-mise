## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate **Project** meal and a masterclass in **Structural Science**. The secret to the legendary "Shattering Skin" is **The 48-Hour Dehydration Pattern**: you must pour boiling water over the raw skin to tighten it, then brush with maltose and air-dry in the fridge, uncovered, for two full days. This separates the skin from the fat layer, ensuring it bakes into a glass-like "Snap" rather than remaining chewy. We maintain **Texture Integrity** by using a wire rack to ensure hot air circulates 360 degrees around the bird.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Pat duck **bone-dry**. Rub 2 tbsp salt over the skin and cavity. Let rest for 1 hour.
2.  **The Blanch:** Pour 6 cups of boiling water slowly over the entire duck skin (both sides). You will see the skin tighten instantly.
3.  **The Lacquer:** Whisk maltose, boiling water, and vinegar. Brush a heavy layer over the duck. Let dry for 1 hour, then brush a second layer.
4.  **The Dehydrate:** Place duck on a wire rack over a tray. **Refrigerate uncovered for 24-48 hours** until the skin feels like parchment paper.
5.  **Thermal Prep:** Bring duck to room temp. Stuff the cavity with aromatics and apples. Seal the opening with skewers.
6.  **Bake:** Preheat convection oven to 390°F (or 425°F conventional). Roast for 15 minutes.
7.  **Roast:** Lower heat to 350°F. Roast for another 60 minutes until the internal temp is 165°F and the skin is dark mahogany. Rest for 15 minutes.
8.  **The Sauce:** Simmer sweet bean sauce, sugar, and a spoonful of rendered duck fat until bubbling.
9.  **Serve:** Slice the skin and meat separately. Serve with thin pancakes, julienned scallions, and cucumber.
