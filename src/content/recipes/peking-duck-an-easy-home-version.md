## Chef's Note

Peking duck from Beijing is famous for its crackling-crisp skin. The secret: pour boiling water over the raw duck to tighten the skin, brush with maltose syrup, then air-dry uncovered in the fridge for 24-48 hours. This separates the skin from the fat layer so it bakes into a glass-like, shatteringly crisp texture. Roast on a wire rack for even air circulation. Serve the skin and meat separately with thin pancakes, scallions, cucumber, and sweet bean sauce.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Pat duck **bone-dry**. Rub 2 tbsp salt over the skin and cavity. Let rest for 1 hour.
2.  **The Blanch:** Pour 6 cups of boiling water slowly over the entire duck skin (both sides). You will see the skin tighten instantly.
3.  **The Lacquer:** Whisk maltose, boiling water, and vinegar. Brush a heavy layer over the duck. Let dry for 1 hour, then brush a second layer.
4.  **The Dehydrate:** Place duck on a wire rack over a tray. **Refrigerate uncovered for 24-48 hours** until the skin feels like parchment paper.
5.  **Thermal Prep:** Bring duck to room temp. Stuff the cavity with aromatics and apples. Seal the opening with skewers.
6.  **Bake:** Preheat convection oven to 390°F (or 425°F conventional). Roast for 15 minutes.
7.  **Roast:** Lower heat to 350°F. Roast for another 60 minutes until the internal temp is 165°F and the skin is dark mahogany. Rest for 15 minutes.
8.  **The Sauce:** Simmer sweet bean sauce, sugar, and a spoonful of rendered duck fat until bubbling.
9.  **Serve:** Slice the skin and meat separately. Serve with thin pancakes, julienned scallions, and cucumber.
