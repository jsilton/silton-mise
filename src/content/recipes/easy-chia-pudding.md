## Chef's Note

This is the baseline for high-performance "Fuel." The secret to a consistent "Bounce" is the **Hydration Cycle Pattern**. You must stir the seeds into the milk, let sit for 5 minutes, and then stir **again** before refrigerating. This second stir breaks up the clumps that form as the seeds' outer mucilaginous layer begins to gel, ensuring a uniform, pudding-like texture throughout. For a "Gold Standard" silky version, see our [Chocolate Chia Pudding](/recipes/chocolate-chia-pudding) Blender Pattern.

## Directions

1.  **Combine:** In a mason jar or bowl, whisk together the chia seeds, milk, maple syrup, and vanilla.
2.  **The First Set:** Let the mixture sit at room temperature for 5 minutes.
3.  **The Second Stir:** Stir or shake the jar vigorously one more time to break up any seed clumps. This is the critical step for **Texture Integrity**.
4.  **Chill:** Cover and refrigerate for **at least 2 hours** (ideally overnight).
5.  **Adjust:** If the pudding is too thick, stir in a splash more milk. If too thin, add 1 tbsp more seeds and wait 30 minutes.
6.  **Serve:** Top with fresh fruit and granola for a crunchy "Snap" contrast.
