## Chef's Note

The common mistake with broccoli is steaming it until it's a limp, sulfurous mess. We apply the **Silton Texture Pattern**: we sear the raw florets in a screaming hot pan until they are charred and nutty on the outside but still have a firm "snap" inside. The soy sauce provides a deep umami seasoning that salt alone cannot match.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Dry the broccoli florets thoroughly. If they are wet, they will steam instead of char.
2.  **Sear:** Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat until smoking. Add the broccoli in a single layer. **Do not move them** for 2 minutes. You want dark, blackened spots.
3.  **Toss:** Toss the broccoli and cook for another 3 minutes.
4.  **Aromatics:** Add the garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook for 1 minute until the garlic is golden.
5.  **Glaze:** Stir in the soy sauce. It will bubble and evaporate instantly, seasoning the broccoli.
6.  **Finish:** Turn off the heat. Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the top.
