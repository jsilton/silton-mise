## Chef's Note

This is an **Authentic Standard** Thai curry. We have removed the Cajun spices and butter from the original family "hack" version to highlight the true aromatics of lemongrass and galangal found in the curry paste. The secret is to avoid "boiling" the paste in liquid; instead, fry the paste in a little oil or coconut cream at the start to release the oils.

## Directions

1.  **Bloom:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok over medium heat. Add the red curry paste. Fry for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until it smells very fragrant and starts to stick.
2.  **Incorporate:** Gradually stir in the coconut milk, whisking until the paste is completely dissolved.
3.  **Simmer:** Add the chicken, bell peppers, and bamboo shoots. Simmer for 10-12 minutes until the chicken is cooked through.
4.  **Balance:** Stir in the fish sauce and brown sugar. Taste: it should be a balance of salty, sweet, and spicy.
5.  **Wilt:** Turn off the heat and stir in the Thai basil leaves.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately over [Jasmine Rice](/silton-mise/recipes/homemade-rice-pilaf).
