## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Coat a 9×13 rimmed sheet pan with nonstick spray, making sure to get the sides and corners. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. Whisk in the eggs, milk, butter, and vanilla until combined and smooth.
3. Pour batter onto the prepared pan. Tap the pan on the counter a few times to even out and flatten the batter.
4. Now imagine the batter divided into four equal sections.
5. In one section, dollop teaspoons of the strawberry jam, then swirl into the batter using a toothpick, making a marbled pattern. Top with sliced strawberries.
6. In another section, sprinkle with the blueberries.
7. In another section, sprinkle chocolate chips.
8. For the last section, whisk together the melted butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Dollop teaspoons of the mixture, then swirl into the batter using a toothpick, making a marbled pattern.
9. Bake for 15-18 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the pancake springs back to the touch.
10. Allow to cool for a minute or so, then slice into portions.
11. Serve with your choice of syrup, butter, powdered sugar, or all three!
