## Chef's Note

Massaging kale with olive oil and salt for 2 minutes breaks down tough cellulose fibers, transforming raw leaves from bitter and chewy to tender and sweet. Roasting bone-dry chickpeas and squash at 450°F creates shatteringly crisp chickpeas that contrast fluffy quinoa and soft roasted squash. Apple cider in the tahini dressing adds tangy brightness that balances the earthy quinoa and sweet squash.

## Directions

1.  **Roast:** Preheat oven to 450°F. Toss chickpeas and squash with spices, oil, and salt. Roast for 25-30 minutes until chickpeas are shatteringly crisp.
2.  **Quinoa:** Simmer quinoa in 1 cup water for 12 minutes. Let stand, covered, for 10 minutes (The Steam Cycle) for maximum fluff.
3.  **Massage:** Place kale in a large bowl with 1 tsp oil and salt. **Massage for 2 minutes** until soft and dark green.
4.  **Dress:** Whisk tahini, lemon juice, cider, and syrup until creamy.
5.  **Assemble:** Toss kale with quinoa and half the dressing.
6.  **Finish:** Top with the roasted chickpeas, squash, pepitas, and raisins. Drizzle with remaining dressing for the mandatory **High Note**.
