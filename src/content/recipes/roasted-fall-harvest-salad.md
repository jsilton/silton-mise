## Chef's Note

This is a high-performance nutritious salad that relies on **Culinary Technique**. The secret to Success is **The Massage Method**: you must massage the kale with olive oil and salt for 2 minutes; this breaks down the cellulose for a tender "Bounce." We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Crispy Chickpea Method**: by roasting the bone-dry chickpeas and squash at 450°F, we create a crunchy Crunch that contrasts the fluffy quinoa. The apple cider in the dressing provides the mandatory **Acid Balance**.

## Directions

1.  **Roast:** Preheat oven to 450°F. Toss chickpeas and squash with spices, oil, and salt. Roast for 25-30 minutes until chickpeas are shatteringly crisp.
2.  **Quinoa:** Simmer quinoa in 1 cup water for 12 minutes. Let stand, covered, for 10 minutes (The Steam Cycle) for maximum fluff.
3.  **Massage:** Place kale in a large bowl with 1 tsp oil and salt. **Massage for 2 minutes** until soft and dark green.
4.  **Dress:** Whisk tahini, lemon juice, cider, and syrup until creamy.
5.  **Assemble:** Toss kale with quinoa and half the dressing.
6.  **Finish:** Top with the roasted chickpeas, squash, pepitas, and raisins. Drizzle with remaining dressing for the mandatory **High Note**.
