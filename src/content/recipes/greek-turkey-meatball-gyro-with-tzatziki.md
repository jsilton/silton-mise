## Chef's Note

Turkey meatballs are the ultimate nutritious but often lack the Texture of beef or lamb. We solve this with **Textural Balance** through **The Spinach-Moisture Guard Method**: by folding in a massive cup of chopped fresh spinach, we create internal moisture pockets that keep the turkey succulent during the high-heat sear. The tzatziki provides the mandatory **Acid Balance**; the secret is squeezing the grated cucumber in a towel until **bone-dry** before adding to the yogurt—this ensures the sauce is thick and creamy rather than a watery mess.

## Directions

1.  **The Mix:** In a large bowl, combine turkey, onion, garlic, oregano, chopped spinach, salt, and pepper. Use your hands to mix **gently** until just combined.
2.  **The Crunch:** Form the mixture into 12 uniform 1-inch balls.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add the meatballs. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side (8-10 mins total) until browned on all sides and the internal temp is 165°F.
4.  **The Sauce:** While meatballs cook, whisk yogurt, squeezed-dry cucumber, lemon juice, dill, and garlic powder in a small bowl. Season with salt.
5.  **Assemble:** Warm the flatbreads in the microwave or on the skillet. Place 3 meatballs in the center of each.
6.  **Finish:** Top with raw red onion, tomatoes, and cucumber. Drizzle generously with the tzatziki for the mandatory **High Note**.
