## Chef's Note

This is a **Modern Heritage** update to the classic holiday side, elevated into a main dish with savory ham. The secret to success is **Texture Integrity** through **The Par-Boil Pattern**: we boil the beans in chicken broth for exactly 5 minutes _before_ baking; this ensures they are "tender-crisp" rather than the squeaky, rubbery texture found in traditional versions. We use **The Cheese Snap Pattern**: by reserving half a cup of cheddar and half the fried onions for the final 10 minutes of baking, we create a multi-textured crust that holds its "Bounce."

## Directions

1.  **Par-Boil:** In a medium pot, bring 4 cups chicken broth or water to a boil. Add green beans and cook for 5-6 minutes. Drain immediately. **Do not rinse.**
2.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter a 9x13 baking dish.
3.  **The Bind:** In a large bowl, whisk together the soup, half-and-half, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
4.  **Mix:** Fold in the par-boiled beans, diced ham, onion, 2 cups of the cheese, and 1/2 cup of the fried onions.
5.  **Assemble:** Pour the mixture into the baking dish.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 30 minutes until bubbling.
7.  **The Snap Finish:** Remove the pan. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese and the remaining 1/2 cup of fried onions over the top. Bake for an additional 10 minutes until the crust is deep golden and shatteringly crisp.
8.  **Rest:** Let sit for 5 minutes before serving to allow the sauce to set.
