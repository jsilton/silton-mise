## Chef's Note

This is the baseline for 10-minute "Speed" main dishes. The secret to its Success is **The Cold Soak Pattern**: we soak the shrimp in cold salted water for 5 minutes _before_ patting them dry; this "plumps" the protein and ensures a resilient "Bounce" under high heat. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The 5-Second Garlic Pulse**: we add the garlic and ginger to the hot oil for only 5 seconds before the shrimp—this captures the raw aromatic "High Note" without any bitter browning.

## Directions

1.  **The Soak:** Soak shrimp in a bowl of cold salted water for 5 minutes. Drain and pat **bone-dry** with paper towels (mandatory for the snap).
2.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together broth, wine, soy sauce, sugar, and cornstarch.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok until smoking. Add shrimp in a single layer. Sear for 1 minute undisturbed to develop a "Snap" crust. Toss for 1 more minute until pink. Remove.
4.  **The Snap:** Add 1 tbsp oil. Sauté garlic, ginger, and snow peas for 1 minute over high heat until bright green.
5.  **Bind:** Pour the cornstarch mixture around the perimeter of the wok. Bring to a boil.
6.  **Finish:** Return the shrimp to the pan. Toss for 30 seconds until the sauce is thick and mirror-glossy.
7.  **Serve:** Stir in the scallions and serve immediately over rice.
