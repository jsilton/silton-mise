## Directions

1. In a large bowl combine 2 cups cold water and 1 tablespoon salt, stirring until salt is dissolved. Add shrimp, and let stand five minutes. Rinse shrimp under cold running water, and set to dry on paper towels. With more towels, pat shrimp dry.
2. In a bowl, combine broth, wine, soy sauce, cornstarch, sugar and pepper.
3. Heat a wok over high heat. To test heat flick a few drops of water into wok. When water vaporizes within 2 seconds, wok is hot. Swirl in 1 tablespoon oil around sides of wok. Add shrimp, spreading them in a single layer, so they have contact with hot metal. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes or just until pink, tossing them with a wok shovel or spatula. Add remaining 2 teaspoons oil, garlic and ginger, and stir-fry 5 seconds. Add snow peas and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and stir-fry 1 minute more.
4. Stir cornstarch mixture, swirl it in around sides of wok, and bring to a boil. Stir-fry just until shrimp are cooked through and sauce has thickened, about 30 seconds more. Stir in scallions, and serve immediately.
