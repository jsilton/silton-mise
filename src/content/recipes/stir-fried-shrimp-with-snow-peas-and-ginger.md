## Chef's Note

This Cantonese quick stir-fry pairs tender shrimp with crisp spring snow peas in a light, ginger-scented sauce. Soaking shrimp in cold salted water before cooking plumps them and improves texture. Adding garlic and ginger to hot oil for just seconds before the shrimp captures their aromatic essence without bitterness.

## Directions

1.  **The Soak:** Soak shrimp in a bowl of cold salted water for 5 minutes. Drain and pat **bone-dry** with paper towels (mandatory for the snap).
2.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together broth, wine, soy sauce, sugar, and cornstarch.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok until smoking. Add shrimp in a single layer. Sear for 1 minute undisturbed to develop a Crunch crust. Toss for 1 more minute until pink. Remove.
4.  **The Crunch:** Add 1 tbsp oil. Sauté garlic, ginger, and snow peas for 1 minute over high heat until bright green.
5.  **Bind:** Pour the cornstarch mixture around the perimeter of the wok. Bring to a boil.
6.  **Finish:** Return the shrimp to the pan. Toss for 30 seconds until the sauce is thick and mirror-glossy.
7.  **Serve:** Stir in the scallions and serve immediately over rice.
