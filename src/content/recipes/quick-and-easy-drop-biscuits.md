## Chef's Note

Drop biscuits are a Southern staple for quick weeknight meals—they skip the rolling and cutting of traditional biscuits. Cold butter cubed into pea-sized pieces steams instantly when it hits a 400°F oven, creating flaky layers within the crumb. Stirring the milk just until the dough comes together prevents gluten development; over-mixing destroys the air pockets and produces dense, leaden biscuits instead of light, tender ones.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2.  **Dry Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.
3.  **The Bind:** Add the cold butter cubes. Use your fingers or a pastry blender to rub the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse meal with a few larger chunks (The Crunch Pockets).
4.  **Hydrate:** Pour in the milk. Stir with a fork for exactly 15-20 seconds until a sticky, shaggy dough forms. **Stop immediately.**
5.  **Drop:** Using a large spoon or cookie scoop, drop walnut-sized mounds onto the pan. Do not smooth the tops—the "nooks and crannies" are essential for the final "Snap."
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 15-18 minutes until the tops are golden brown and the bottoms are crispy.
7.  **Serve:** Serve warm with plenty of salted butter and honey.
