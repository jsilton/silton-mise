## Chef's Note
The drop biscuit is the ultimate test of **Structural Science** in speed-baking. The secret to a tall, flaky "Bounce" is **The Cold Fat Pattern**: the butter must be refrigerator-cold and cubed into pea-sized pieces. When these cold fat pockets hit the 400°F oven, they steam instantly, creating layers within the crumb. We use **The Shaggy Dough Pattern**: you must stir the milk until the dough **just comes together**; over-mixing will destroy the air pockets and turn your biscuits into leaden pucks.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2.  **Dry Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.
3.  **The Bind:** Add the cold butter cubes. Use your fingers or a pastry blender to rub the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse meal with a few larger chunks (The Snap Pockets).
4.  **Hydrate:** Pour in the milk. Stir with a fork for exactly 15-20 seconds until a sticky, shaggy dough forms. **Stop immediately.**
5.  **Drop:** Using a large spoon or cookie scoop, drop walnut-sized mounds onto the pan. Do not smooth the tops—the "nooks and crannies" are essential for the final "Snap."
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 15-18 minutes until the tops are golden brown and the bottoms are crispy.
7.  **Serve:** Serve warm with plenty of salted butter and honey.
