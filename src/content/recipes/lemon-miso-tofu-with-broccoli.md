## Chef's Note

This is a quick, nutritious dish that solves the problem of soggy tofu. By dredging the tofu in cornstarch before searing, we create a barrier that ensures a shatteringly crisp exterior. We char the broccoli in the same pan to pick up the tofu's crispiness. The combination of miso and lemon provides the essential brightness that bridges the earthy soy and citrus flavors.

## Directions

1.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk miso, lemon juice, maple syrup, 1 tbsp cornstarch, and hot water until smooth.
2.  **The Crunch:** Toss dry tofu cubes in 1/3 cup cornstarch, salt, and pepper until "dusty."
3.  **Sear Tofu:** Heat 3 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Fry tofu for 2-3 minutes per side until golden and very crisp. Remove to a plate.
4.  **Sear Veg:** In the same pan, sauté broccoli for 6-7 minutes until tender and charred at the edges. Remove and set aside.
5.  **The Glaze:** Wipe the pan. Add sesame oil, garlic, and ginger; sauté for 30 seconds. Pour in the miso-lemon mixture. Simmer for 3 minutes until thick and glossy.
6.  **Bind:** Return tofu and broccoli to the pan. Toss vigorously for 30 seconds to coat.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with scallions and serve hot over rice.
