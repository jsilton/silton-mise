## Directions

1. Prepare the lemon-miso sauce: in a medium bowl or jug, add the just-boiled water and the miso paste and stir to dissolve it. Add the lemon juice, maple syrup, cornstarch and salt, and stir to combine. Set aside.
2. Prepare the tofu: Place the cornstarch on a large plate or tray. Season with salt and pepper and toss to combine. Add the tofu cubes and toss to coat all sides.
3. Heat a large (12-inch) nonstick or well-seasoned skillet on medium-high for 2 minutes. Drizzle with 3 tablespoons canola oil, swirling it around to coat the base, and add the tofu. Cook until golden and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes per side. If the pan gets dry, add a bit more oil and reduce heat to medium if the pan gets too smoky. Transfer the tofu to a large plate.
4. If the skillet is dry, drizzle with a bit more oil. With the heat on medium-high, add the broccoli, season with salt and pepper, and cook, tossing often, until tender and charred around the edges, 6 to 7 minutes (reduce heat to medium if it gets too hot and smoky). Transfer the broccoli to the same plate as the tofu.
5. Finish the lemon-miso sauce: Give the skillet a quick rinse or wipe it out with paper towels to remove any burnt bits and place it back on medium heat for 1 minute. Add the sesame oil, garlic and ginger to the skillet and bloom for 30 seconds, stirring, until fragrant. Give the lemon cornstarch mixture a stir and then pour it into the skillet. Cook, stirring, until thickened and glossy, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat.
6. Add the tofu and broccoli to the lemon-miso sauce and toss to coat. Scatter with the scallions, and serve immediately with rice.
