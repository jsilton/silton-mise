## Chef's Note

This is a high-speed nutritious masterpiece that solves the problem of soggy tofu. We use **Culinary Technique** through **The Cornstarch Guard Method**: by dredging the tofu in starch before searing, we create a barrier that ensures a shatteringly crisp "Snap." We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Perimeter Sear**: we char the broccoli in the same pan to pick up the tofu's crispiness. The combination of miso and lemon provides the mandatory **Acid Balance** that bridges the earthy soy and bright citrus.

## Directions

1.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk miso, lemon juice, maple syrup, 1 tbsp cornstarch, and hot water until smooth.
2.  **The Crunch:** Toss dry tofu cubes in 1/3 cup cornstarch, salt, and pepper until "dusty."
3.  **Sear Tofu:** Heat 3 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Fry tofu for 2-3 minutes per side until golden and very crisp. Remove to a plate.
4.  **Sear Veg:** In the same pan, sauté broccoli for 6-7 minutes until tender and charred at the edges. Remove and set aside.
5.  **The Glaze:** Wipe the pan. Add sesame oil, garlic, and ginger; sauté for 30 seconds. Pour in the miso-lemon mixture. Simmer for 3 minutes until thick and glossy.
6.  **Bind:** Return tofu and broccoli to the pan. Toss vigorously for 30 seconds to coat.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with scallions and serve hot over rice.
