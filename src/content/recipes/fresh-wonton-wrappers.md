## Chef's Note

Homemade wonton wrappers have a delicate, silky texture that's hard to match with store-bought. The dough should be quite firm after kneading, then rested for 30-60 minutes to relax the gluten so you can roll it paper-thin. The key: use cornstarch for dusting between sheets, never flour. Flour will absorb into the dough and make it gummy, while cornstarch keeps them separate and provides a smooth finish when boiled.

## Directions

1.  **Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk the flour and salt. Make a well in the center. Add the egg and water. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.
2.  **Knead:** Turn out onto a clean surface and knead for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. The dough should be quite firm.
3.  **Rest:** Wrap in plastic and let rest at room temperature for at least 30-60 minutes. This relaxes the gluten so you can roll it paper-thin.
4.  **Roll:** Divide dough into 4 pieces. Use a pasta machine (recommended) or a heavy rolling pin. Roll until the dough is thin enough to see your hand through it (Setting 6 or 7 on most pasta machines).
5.  **Cut:** Dust generously with cornstarch. Cut into 3.5-inch squares.
6.  **Store:** Stack with plenty of cornstarch between layers. Wrap tightly in plastic. (Can be refrigerated for 2 days or frozen for 3 months).
