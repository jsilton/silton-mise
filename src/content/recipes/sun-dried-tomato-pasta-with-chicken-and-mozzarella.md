## Chef's Note

The secret to this 30-minute "Speed" meal is **The Tomato-Oil Sear Pattern**. You must use the oil reserved from the sun-dried tomato jar to sear the chicken; this infuses the protein with a deep, concentrated tomato intensity _before_ the cream is added. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The Mozzarella Bind**: by whisking the cheese directly into the simmering cream, we create a stable, tacky glaze that has the "Bounce" to cling to the penne without needing a heavy flour roux. The red pepper flakes provide the mandatory savory **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** Drain sun-dried tomatoes, reserving 2 tbsp of their oil. Sauté garlic and the tomatoes in that oil for 1 minute until fragrant.
2.  **The Sear:** Add sliced chicken (seasoned with paprika and salt). Cook over high heat for 2 minutes per side until charred. Remove to a plate.
3.  **Boil:** Cook penne until **al dente**. **Reserve 1 cup of pasta water**.
4.  **Emulsify:** In the skillet, combine the half-and-half and mozzarella. Bring to a gentle boil, then simmer, stirring constantly, until the cheese has melted into a thick, glossy silk.
5.  **Bind:** Return the chicken and any juices to the pan. Add the hot pasta, spinach, and basil.
6.  **Toss:** Toss vigorously for 1 minute. Add pasta water 1/4 cup at a time until the sauce is creamy and the spinach has just wilted.
7.  **Serve:** Season with extra red pepper flakes and serve hot.
