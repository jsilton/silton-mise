## Chef's Note

Sun-dried tomatoes became hugely popular in Italian-American cooking during the 1990s. The oil from the jar is liquid gold—use it to sear the chicken so the protein absorbs intense tomato flavor before the cream goes in. Whisking shredded mozzarella directly into simmering cream creates a thick, clingy sauce without needing a flour roux. Red pepper flakes add a gentle heat that balances the rich, creamy base.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** Drain sun-dried tomatoes, reserving 2 tbsp of their oil. Sauté garlic and the tomatoes in that oil for 1 minute until fragrant.
2.  **The Sear:** Add sliced chicken (seasoned with paprika and salt). Cook over high heat for 2 minutes per side until charred. Remove to a plate.
3.  **Boil:** Cook penne until **al dente**. **Reserve 1 cup of pasta water**.
4.  **Emulsify:** In the skillet, combine the half-and-half and mozzarella. Bring to a gentle boil, then simmer, stirring constantly, until the cheese has melted into a thick, glossy silk.
5.  **Bind:** Return the chicken and any juices to the pan. Add the hot pasta, spinach, and basil.
6.  **Toss:** Toss vigorously for 1 minute. Add pasta water 1/4 cup at a time until the sauce is creamy and the spinach has just wilted.
7.  **Serve:** Season with extra red pepper flakes and serve hot.
