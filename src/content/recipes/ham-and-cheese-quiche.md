## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
2. Press the dough around the edges of a 9-inch tart pan or pie dish. Place on a baking sheet. Pierce the bottom of the pie crust with a fork. Bake 5 minutes and then remove from oven. Set aside.
3. In a small frying pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add onions and sauté 2 minutes. Stir in ham and bacon pieces and cook an additional 3 minutes, or until the onions have caramelized. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
4. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and half-and-half. Stir in cheddar, mozzarella, parsley flakes, pepper, spinach, and the ham mixture. Pour into the tart pan.
5. Bake 25 to 35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and let cool slightly. Enjoy while warm!

## Notes

Substitute milk: If you don’t have any half-and-half on hand, you can use milk. I prefer half-and-half because it makes the quiche extra creamy and delicious.Crustless: Check out my favorite crustless quiche recipe. It’s super similar, just without the pie crust.Variations: Feel free to add in extra veggies, like mushrooms or peppers.Storing: Let cool completely, then wrap the pan tightly with aluminum foil or plastic wrap. Place in fridge for up to 3 days.Freezing: You can also freeze the quiche (wrapped tightly in aluminum foil and plastic wrap up to 2 months.Reheating: Cover with foil and bake at 400°F until the quiche is warm throughout.
