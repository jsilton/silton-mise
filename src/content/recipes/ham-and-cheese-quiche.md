## Chef's Note

Pre-baking the crust for 5 minutes creates a moisture barrier that prevents soggy bottom—essential for any quiche. A ratio of 5 eggs to 1/2 cup cream produces firm, sliceable custard that remains creamy rather than rubbery. Sautéing the onions in butter first develops their natural sweetness, providing contrast to salty ham.

## Directions

1.  **Blind Bake:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Pierce the bottom of the pie crust with a fork. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 5-7 minutes. Remove and set aside.
2.  **The Sauté:** In a small skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Sauté onions for 2-3 minutes until translucent. Add the ham and optional bacon; cook for 2 more minutes until slightly browned. Remove from heat.
3.  **The Custard:** In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and half-and-half until perfectly smooth and frothy.
4.  **Assemble:** Scatter the ham mixture, spinach, and both cheeses into the pre-baked crust. Pour the egg custard slowly over the fillings.
5.  **Bake:** Reduce oven to 375°F. Bake for 25-35 minutes until the top is deep golden brown and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
6.  **Rest:** Let the quiche rest for 10 minutes before slicing. This allows the custard to fully set.
