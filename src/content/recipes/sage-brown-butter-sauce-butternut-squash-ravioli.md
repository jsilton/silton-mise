## Chef's Note

This is a 15-minute "Speed" masterpiece. The secret to its elite flavor is **The Beurre Noisette Pattern**: we cook the butter until it foams and the milk solids turn a deep "peanut butter" brown _before_ adding the sage. This creates a nutty, toasted foundation that defines the dish. We use **The Broth-Cream Bind**: adding chicken broth to the brown butter prevents it from feeling greasy, while the heavy cream provides the mandatory "Bounce" to the sauce. The lemon juice is the final **Acid Finish** needed to cut the rich squash.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook ravioli in salted water according to package directions. Drain.
2.  **Brown Butter:** In a large light-colored skillet (mandatory to see color), melt butter over medium. Whisk constantly for 5 minutes until it smells like nuts and golden flecks appear.
3.  **Crisp Sage:** Add the sage. Fry for 1 minute until the leaves are "Snappy" and fragrant.
4.  **Emulsify:** Carefully pour in the broth and cream (it will splatter). Whisk vigorously until a smooth, thick emulsion forms.
5.  **Bind:** Stir in the Parmesan and lemon juice.
6.  **Toss:** Add the cooked ravioli to the pan. Toss for 1 minute until every pillow is coated in the brown butter silk.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with extra Parmesan and a crack of black pepper.
