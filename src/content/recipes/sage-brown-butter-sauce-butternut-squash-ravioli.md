## Chef's Note

Brown butter and sage is a classic Northern Italian sauce, especially popular with filled pasta like ravioli or tortellini. The French call it beurre noisette ("hazelnut butter") for its nutty aroma. Cook the butter until golden-brown before adding sage—this deepens the flavor dramatically. Adding broth and cream to brown butter prevents it from feeling too rich or greasy. A squeeze of lemon juice at the end brightens the sweet squash filling.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook ravioli in salted water according to package directions. Drain.
2.  **Brown Butter:** In a large light-colored skillet (mandatory to see color), melt butter over medium. Whisk constantly for 5 minutes until it smells like nuts and golden flecks appear.
3.  **Crisp Sage:** Add the sage. Fry for 1 minute until the leaves are crispy and fragrant.
4.  **Emulsify:** Carefully pour in the broth and cream (it will splatter). Whisk vigorously until a smooth, thick emulsion forms.
5.  **Bind:** Stir in the Parmesan and lemon juice.
6.  **Toss:** Add the cooked ravioli to the pan. Toss for 1 minute until every pillow is coated in the brown butter silk.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with extra Parmesan and a crack of black pepper.
