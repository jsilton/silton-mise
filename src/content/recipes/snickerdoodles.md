## Chef's Note

What separates a Snickerdoodle from a standard sugar cookie is **Chemistry**. The **Cream of Tartar** provides the signature tangy flavor and reacts with the baking soda to create a uniquely chewy, pillowy texture that prevents the cookie from becoming too crisp. This is a comfort-food staple that relies on simple, high-quality ingredients.

## Directions

1.  **Cream:** Beat the butter, 1 1/2 cups sugar, and eggs until very light and fluffy.
2.  **Sift:** In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt.
3.  **Mix:** Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture until just combined.
4.  **Chill:** Refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes. This makes it easier to roll and prevents excessive spreading.
5.  **Roll:** Shape dough into walnut-sized balls. Roll each ball in the cinnamon-sugar mixture until fully coated.
6.  **Bake:** Place on a baking sheet 2 inches apart. Bake at 400°F for 8-10 minutes. The cookies should be set at the edges but still appear soft in the center.
