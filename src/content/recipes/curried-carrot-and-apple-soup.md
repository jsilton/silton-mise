## Chef's Note

This soup is a masterclass in **Texture Integrity** through our **Gingersnap Thickener Pattern**. Instead of a flour roux, we use crushed gingersnap cookies; the spices in the cookies complement the curry, while their starch provides a velvety body. The secret to the Silton Standard here is the **Acid Finish**: the combination of tart Granny Smith apple and apple cider vinegar provides the mandatory "High Note" that brightens the earthy carrots and rich cream.

## Directions

1.  **Aromatics:** In a large heavy-bottomed pot, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add onion, leek, and fennel with a pinch of salt. Sauté for 9 minutes until soft and starting to brown.
2.  **The Base:** Add carrots, celery root, apple, gingersnaps, curry powder, garlic, ginger, and thyme. Sauté for 10 minutes until the vegetables soften slightly and the cookies begin to dissolve.
3.  **Simmer:** Pour in the chicken stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 25 minutes until all vegetables are fork-tender. Remove thyme sprigs.
4.  **The Emulsion:** Working in batches, puree the soup in a blender with the sour cream and apple cider vinegar until completely smooth.
5.  **Finish:** Return to the pot to warm through. Taste and adjust with salt and pepper.
6.  **Serve:** Ladle into bowls and top with toasted pumpkin seeds and fresh herbs for **Texture Integrity**.
