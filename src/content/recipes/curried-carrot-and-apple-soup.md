## Chef's Note

Gingersnap cookies replace flour as a thickener - their spices complement the curry while their starch creates velvety body. Tart Granny Smith apple and apple cider vinegar brighten the earthy carrots and rich sour cream. Top with toasted pumpkin seeds for textural contrast.

## Directions

1.  **Aromatics:** In a large heavy-bottomed pot, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add onion, leek, and fennel with a pinch of salt. Sauté for 9 minutes until soft and starting to brown.
2.  **The Base:** Add carrots, celery root, apple, gingersnaps, curry powder, garlic, ginger, and thyme. Sauté for 10 minutes until the vegetables soften slightly and the cookies begin to dissolve.
3.  **Simmer:** Pour in the chicken stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 25 minutes until all vegetables are fork-tender. Remove thyme sprigs.
4.  **The Emulsion:** Working in batches, puree the soup in a blender with the sour cream and apple cider vinegar until completely smooth.
5.  **Finish:** Return to the pot to warm through. Taste and adjust with salt and pepper.
6.  **Serve:** Ladle into bowls and top with toasted pumpkin seeds and fresh herbs for **Textural Balance**.
