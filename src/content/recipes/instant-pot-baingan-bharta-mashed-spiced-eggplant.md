## Chef's Note
Baingan Bharta is traditionally made by roasting eggplant over an open flame for smokiness. In the Instant Pot, we replicate this depth with **Structural Science** through **The Post-Pressure Sauté Pattern**. After the high-pressure cycle, we use the "Sauté" function to boil off excess water and "fry" the eggplant mash against the bottom of the pot; this develops the Maillard sweetness and concentrated umami found in the traditional version. The fresh lemon juice is the mandatory **Acid Finish** to brighten the heavy spices.

## Directions

1.  **The Bloom:** Press "Sauté" on the Instant Pot. Add oil. Once hot, add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for 30 seconds. Add the onion and sauté for 6-7 minutes until deep golden brown.
2.  **Aromatics:** Stir in the garlic, ginger, and all ground spices. Sauté for 1 minute until fragrant. Add tomatoes and cook for 4 minutes until they break down into a thick paste.
3.  **Pressure:** Add the eggplant cubes and 1/4 cup water. Secure the lid. Set to **High Pressure for 7 minutes**.
4.  **Release:** Perform a "Quick Release" of the pressure. 
5.  **The Mash:** Open the lid. Use a potato masher or heavy spoon to crush the eggplant into a coarse, uniform mash.
6.  **The Sauté:** Press "Sauté" again. Cook the mash for 3-5 minutes, stirring frequently, until any liquid has evaporated and the eggplant looks glossy and concentrated.
7.  **Finish:** Stir in the fresh cilantro and lemon juice. Serve hot.
