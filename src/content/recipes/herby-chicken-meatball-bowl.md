## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate high-performance nutritious bowl. The secret to chicken meatballs that aren't dry is **Culinary Technique** through **The Ricotta Bounce Hack**: by folding whole-milk ricotta into the ground chicken, we create a fat-moisture barrier that ensures the meatballs remain succulent even after searing. We use **The Cylindrical Sear Method**: shaping the meat into small logs rather than balls provides more Maillard surface area, resulting in a deeper savory Crunch against the bright, herbal yogurt dressing.

## Directions

1.  **Stage 1 (Roast):** Preheat oven to 400°F. On one sheet pan, toss bone-dry chickpeas with olive oil, salt, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. On another pan, toss sweet potato cubes with olive oil, cinnamon, and cumin. Roast both for 15-20 minutes until crispy.
2.  **The Meatballs:** In a large bowl, combine chicken, ricotta, egg, panko, shallots, greens, and lemon zest. Mix **gently** until just combined.
3.  **Shape:** Form into 12 small cylindrical logs (about 2 tbsp each).
4.  **Sear:** Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Sear the meatballs for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and the internal temp is 165°F.
5.  **The Emulsion:** In a food processor, blend the yogurt, basil, jalapeño, honey, and lemon juice until vibrant green and smooth.
6.  **Assemble:** Divide the kale among four bowls. Top with the roasted chickpeas, sweet potatoes, and meatballs.
7.  **Finish:** Drizzle generously with the dressing for the mandatory **Acid Balance**.
