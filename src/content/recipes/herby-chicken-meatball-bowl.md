## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400F. Begin by making the parmesan roasted chickpeas. Drain the chickpeas and pat them dry with paper towels. Transfer the beans to a baking sheet.
2. Add the olive oil, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, herbs de province, and parmesan cheese. Toss until everything is well coated. Transfer to the oven and bake for 15 minutes.
3. While the chickpeas roast, start on the sweet potatoes. Cut the sweet potato into bite-sized pieces. Transfer to a baking sheet and add the olive oil, salt, cinnamon, and cumin. Toss until everything is well coated. Transfer to the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, until sweet potatoes are cooked through and starting to brown.
4. While the sweet potatoes and chickpeas cook, make the chicken meatballs. Add all the ingredients (except the olive oil) to a bowl. Mix until well combined. Scoop out about 2 tbsp of the chicken mixture. Use your hands to form the chicken into a cylinder shape (you can also just roll them into balls, but I like having more surface area to brown).
5. Add the olive oil (2 tbsp) to a large pan over medium-high heat. Add half of the meatballs and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, until golden brown and until the internal temperature reaches 165 F. Repeat with the remaining chicken.
6. While the chicken meatballs cook, make the dressing. Add all the ingredients (greek yogurt, fresh basil, fresh dill, juice of a lemon, olive oil, honey, jalapeño, garlic, salt, and pepper) to a food processor or blender. Blend until smooth.
7. To assemble, divide the kale, sweet potatoes, roasted chickpeas, and chicken meatballs between bowls. Top with plenty of yogurt jalapeño dressing and enjoy!
