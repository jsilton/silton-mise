## Chef's Note

Folding whole-milk ricotta into ground chicken creates a fat-moisture barrier that keeps meatballs succulent even after searing—a technique borrowed from Italian polpette. Shaping the meat into small logs rather than balls provides more surface area for browning, developing deeper savory flavor that contrasts beautifully with the bright, herbal yogurt dressing.

## Directions

1.  **Stage 1 (Roast):** Preheat oven to 400°F. On one sheet pan, toss bone-dry chickpeas with olive oil, salt, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. On another pan, toss sweet potato cubes with olive oil, cinnamon, and cumin. Roast both for 15-20 minutes until crispy.
2.  **The Meatballs:** In a large bowl, combine chicken, ricotta, egg, panko, shallots, greens, and lemon zest. Mix **gently** until just combined.
3.  **Shape:** Form into 12 small cylindrical logs (about 2 tbsp each).
4.  **Sear:** Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Sear the meatballs for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and the internal temp is 165°F.
5.  **The Emulsion:** In a food processor, blend the yogurt, basil, jalapeño, honey, and lemon juice until vibrant green and smooth.
6.  **Assemble:** Divide the kale among four bowls. Top with the roasted chickpeas, sweet potatoes, and meatballs.
7.  **Finish:** Drizzle generously with the dressing for the mandatory **Acid Balance**.
