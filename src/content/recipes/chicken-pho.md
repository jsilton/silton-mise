## Chef's Note

The secret to a golden, aromatic Chicken Pho is the **Char**. You must roast the onions and ginger until they are blackened and softened; this provides the smoky, sweet backbone of the broth. We use a combination of a whole chicken (for meat) and extra wings (for gelatin) to achieve that lip-smacking richness. Unlike beef pho, chicken pho should be lighter and cleaner—don't over-boil, just a gentle simmer.

## Directions

1.  **The Char:** Place halved onions and ginger under the **BROILER** for 10-15 minutes until blackened and fragrant. Peel off the loose charred skins.
2.  **The Spices:** In a small dry pan, toast the star anise, cinnamon, and coriander seeds until they smell nutty (2 mins).
3.  **The First Simmer:** In a large stockpot, combine water, whole chicken, wings, charred aromatics, and toasted spices. Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce to a **very gentle simmer**.
4.  **Meat:** After 30-40 minutes, remove the whole chicken. Submerge it in a bowl of cold water for 5 minutes (this prevents the skin from darkening), then shred the meat and refrigerate. Return the bones to the pot.
5.  **The Long Simmer:** Continue simmering the bones and aromatics for 2 more hours. Periodically skim any foam from the surface.
6.  **Finish:** Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard solids. Stir in the fish sauce, sugar, and salt. Adjust to your palate.
7.  **Noodles:** Soak rice sticks in warm water for 20 minutes, then flash-boil for 1 minute just before serving.
8.  **Assemble:** Place noodles in deep bowls. Top with shredded chicken and hot broth. Serve with a plate of fresh herbs, sprouts, and lime.
