## Chef's Note

Using whole chicken legs instead of boneless chicken extracts collagen and fat during slow-cooking, creating a rich, gelatinous broth similar to restaurant ramen. Stirring miso paste in at the start infuses the meat, while whisking in an extra spoonful at the end maintains its fresh, funky flavor—prolonged heat destroys miso's probiotic qualities and mutes its taste. Adding bok choy only during the final 10 minutes keeps it tender-crisp.

## Directions

1.  **Simmer:** In a 6-quart slow cooker, combine chicken legs, miso, scallion whites, garlic, dried shiitakes, and 6 cups water. **Cook on Low for 6 hours**.
2.  **The Pull:** Using a slotted spoon, remove the chicken and shiitakes. Set aside to cool. Shred the meat, discarding skin and bones. Slice the shiitakes.
3.  **The Infusion:** Set slow cooker to **High**. Stir in the kombu, baby bok choy, tamari, and mirin. Cover and cook for 10 minutes until the bok choy is tender-crisp. Discard kombu.
4.  **Emulsify:** Return the chicken and shiitakes to the pot. Taste and whisk in an extra spoonful of miso if you want a saltier "Snap."
5.  **Assemble:** Boil ramen noodles separately for 2 minutes. Divide noodles among bowls.
6.  **Serve:** Ladle the hot miso broth and chicken over the noodles. Top with a soft-boiled egg, nori, and sesame seeds.
