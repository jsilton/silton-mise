## Chef's Note
The secret to "Restaurant Quality" slow-cooker ramen is **Structural Science** through **The Bone-In Simmer Pattern**. By using whole chicken legs, we extract collagen and deep gelatinous fat that provides the mandatory "Bounce" to the broth. We use **The Miso Tempering Pattern**: we stir the miso in at the start to infuse the meat, but whisk in a secondary pulse at the end to maintain its raw, probiotic "High Note." The bok choy is added only during the final 10 minutes to ensure **Texture Integrity**.

## Directions

1.  **Simmer:** In a 6-quart slow cooker, combine chicken legs, miso, scallion whites, garlic, dried shiitakes, and 6 cups water. **Cook on Low for 6 hours**.
2.  **The Pull:** Using a slotted spoon, remove the chicken and shiitakes. Set aside to cool. Shred the meat, discarding skin and bones. Slice the shiitakes.
3.  **The Infusion:** Set slow cooker to **High**. Stir in the kombu, baby bok choy, tamari, and mirin. Cover and cook for 10 minutes until the bok choy is tender-crisp. Discard kombu.
4.  **Emulsify:** Return the chicken and shiitakes to the pot. Taste and whisk in an extra spoonful of miso if you want a saltier "Snap."
5.  **Assemble:** Boil ramen noodles separately for 2 minutes. Divide noodles among bowls.
6.  **Serve:** Ladle the hot miso broth and chicken over the noodles. Top with a soft-boiled egg, nori, and sesame seeds.
