## Chef's Note

This is the "Bernard's Style" roast pork—meaty, sweet, and sticky. While traditional Char Siu is hung in a specialized oven, we achieve the same result by roasting on a rack and **basting** repeatedly with the honey-glaze to build up that dark, caramelized lacquer. Sliced thin, it is the ultimate topping for wonton soup.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** Whisk all marinade ingredients. Toss the pork strips in the sauce, coating well. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, ideally overnight.
2.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack on top. Place the pork on the rack (reserve the marinade).
3.  **Roast:** Roast for 15 minutes.
4.  **The Glaze:** While pork roasts, simmer the reserved marinade in a small pan for 5 minutes to thicken into a glaze.
5.  **Baste:** Remove pork from oven. Brush generously with the glaze. Flip and brush the other side.
6.  **Finish:** Reduce oven to 375°F. Roast for another 20-25 minutes, basting every 10 minutes, until the internal temp is 145°F and the edges are charred and sticky.
7.  **Rest:** Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing into thin medallions.
