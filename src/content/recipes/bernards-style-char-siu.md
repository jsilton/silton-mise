## Chef's Note

Char siu is Cantonese barbecued pork, traditionally hung and roasted in special ovens. The name means "fork roasted" from the long forks used to hang the meat. This home version uses a rack and repeated basting with honey glaze to build up the signature sticky, caramelized coating. Marinate overnight for the best flavor penetration. The five-spice powder gives it the distinctive sweet-savory aroma. Slice thin and serve over rice or as a topping for noodle soups.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** Whisk all marinade ingredients. Toss the pork strips in the sauce, coating well. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, ideally overnight.
2.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack on top. Place the pork on the rack (reserve the marinade).
3.  **Roast:** Roast for 15 minutes.
4.  **The Glaze:** While pork roasts, simmer the reserved marinade in a small pan for 5 minutes to thicken into a glaze.
5.  **Baste:** Remove pork from oven. Brush generously with the glaze. Flip and brush the other side.
6.  **Finish:** Reduce oven to 375°F. Roast for another 20-25 minutes, basting every 10 minutes, until the internal temp is 145°F and the edges are charred and sticky.
7.  **Rest:** Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing into thin medallions.
