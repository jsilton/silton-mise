## Chef's Note

This is a masterclass in **Textural Balance** through **The Burst-Tomato Method**. The secret to Success is adding the tomatoes in two stages: we roast the first batch until they burst and emulsify with the balsamic vinegar to create a sauce, then add the second batch for the final 10 minutes. This ensures you have both a rich Texture sauce and whole, crispy tomatoes in every bite. We use **Slabs of Feta** instead of crumbles; the roasted cheese develops a brown, caramelized skin that provides a savory Crunch against the sweet honey-balsamic glaze.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 425°F. In a medium bowl, whisk together vinegar, oil, honey, mustard, and spices.
2.  **The Base:** Toss chicken and onions in the balsamic mixture. Place on a large sheet pan. Arrange 2 cups of the tomatoes and the slabs of feta around the meat.
3.  **Stage 1:** Bake for 10 minutes.
4.  **Stage 2:** Add the remaining 2 cups of tomatoes to the pan. Drizzle with any leftover balsamic glaze from the bowl.
5.  **Bake:** Roast for 10-15 more minutes until the chicken reaches **160°F** (it will carry to 165°F) and the tomatoes have just burst.
6.  **Finish:** Garnish with a massive amount of fresh basil and cracked black pepper for the mandatory **High Note**.
