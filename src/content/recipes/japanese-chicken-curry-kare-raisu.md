## Chef's Note
This is the definitive "from scratch" method for Japanese Curry using the professional **Yoshoku Technique**. The secret to its depth is **The Darkness Roux Pattern**: we cook the butter and flour for 20 minutes until it reaches a "milk chocolate" brown—this provides the nutty, roasted backbone that cubes cannot replicate. We maintain **Texture Integrity** by using the **Rangiri Cut** for carrots, ensuring they hold their "Snap" through the long simmer. The grated apple is the mandatory **High Note** that balances the intensity of the S&B powder.

## Directions

1.  **Foundation:** Heat oil in a large pot. Sauté onions with a pinch of salt for 20 minutes until they turn into a deep golden brown paste. Do not rush this.
2.  **Simmer:** Add chicken and cook until opaque. Add garlic, ginger, carrots, potatoes, and stock. Bring to a boil, skim the surface, then simmer for 15 minutes.
3.  **The Roux:** In a separate pan, melt 4 tbsp butter. Whisk in flour. Stir constantly for 15-20 minutes until the roux is dark brown. 
4.  **Bloom:** Add the curry powder and garam masala to the roux. Stir for 30 seconds until fragrant. 
5.  **Emulsify:** Whisk 1/2 cup of the hot broth into the roux to form a paste, then pour the paste back into the main pot.
6.  **Season:** Stir in the grated apple, Worcestershire, ketchup, and soy sauce.
7.  **Finish:** Simmer uncovered for 10 more minutes until the sauce is glossy and thick. Serve over steamed rice.
