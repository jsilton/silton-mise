The definitive "from scratch" method for Japanese Curry using S&B Oriental Curry Powder (The Red Tin). Unlike home-style recipes, this uses the professional "Yoshoku" technique: caramelizing onions for depth and creating a separate dark brown roux to achieve the signature glossy, rich sauce found in Tokyo curry houses.

## Directions

1. Caramelize Onions (The Foundation): Heat oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and a pinch of salt. Sauté for 20 minutes, stirring frequently, until they turn a deep golden brown paste. Do not rush this; this provides the savory base.
2. Sear & Simmer: Add the chicken to the pot and cook until the outside is white/opaque (3 mins). Add the garlic and grated ginger; fry for 1 minute. Add the carrots, potatoes, and chicken stock.
3. The First Cook: Bring to a boil, skim off any foam/scum from the surface, then lower heat to a gentle simmer. Cover and cook for 15 minutes or until potatoes are tender.
4. Make the Roux (While Stew Simmers): In a small separate frying pan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the flour. Stir constantly for 15–20 minutes. You want the flour to cook from white to "peanut butter" color to a light "milk chocolate" brown.
5. Bloom Spices: Once the flour is brown, add the S&B Red Tin Powder and Garam Masala to the butter/flour mix. Stir for 30 seconds until fragrant (this releases the oils). Remove roux from heat.
6. Combine: Ladle about 1/2 cup of the hot broth from the main pot into the roux pan. Whisk it into a paste (this prevents lumps). Pour this paste back into the main soup pot.
7. Thicken & Season: Stir well. The soup will thicken into a rich gravy. Add the Hidden Flavors (Worcestershire, Ketchup, Soy Sauce, Grated Apple).
8. Finish: Simmer uncovered on low for another 10 minutes to let the flavors meld and the sauce become glossy. Taste and adjust salt.

## Notes

The Apple: Grated apple is the classic "secret ingredient" in Japan. It balances the harsh spices of the Red Tin powder.The Rest: Like all stews, this tastes significantly better the next day as the spices mellow.Garam Masala: Adding a spoon of this at the end adds the "sweet spice" aroma (cinnamon/cloves) that S&B powder sometimes lacks.
