## Chef's Note

Japanese curry (kare raisu) is yoshoku—Western-influenced Japanese cuisine that emerged in the Meiji era. The secret to depth when making it from scratch is cooking butter and flour for 20 minutes until milk-chocolate brown, creating a nutty, roasted roux that curry cubes cannot replicate. The rangiri cut (rolling wedges) for carrots ensures they hold texture through long simmering. Grated apple balances the intensity of curry powder—a common yoshoku trick.

## Directions

1.  **Foundation:** Heat oil in a large pot. Sauté onions with a pinch of salt for 20 minutes until they turn into a deep golden brown paste. Do not rush this.
2.  **Simmer:** Add chicken and cook until opaque. Add garlic, ginger, carrots, potatoes, and stock. Bring to a boil, skim the surface, then simmer for 15 minutes.
3.  **The Roux:** In a separate pan, melt 4 tbsp butter. Whisk in flour. Stir constantly for 15-20 minutes until the roux is dark brown.
4.  **Bloom:** Add the curry powder and garam masala to the roux. Stir for 30 seconds until fragrant.
5.  **Emulsify:** Whisk 1/2 cup of the hot broth into the roux to form a paste, then pour the paste back into the main pot.
6.  **Season:** Stir in the grated apple, Worcestershire, ketchup, and soy sauce.
7.  **Finish:** Simmer uncovered for 10 more minutes until the sauce is glossy and thick. Serve over steamed rice.
