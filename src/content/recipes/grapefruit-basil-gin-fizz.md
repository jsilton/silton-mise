## Chef's Note

Muddling the basil before adding liquids releases its chlorophyll and essential oils, creating the botanical foundation of this cocktail. Fresh pink grapefruit provides bright acidity, amplified with Angostura bitters to bridge the gap between bitter tonic and sweet citrus. The result is a refreshing, herbaceous drink perfect for warm weather.

## Directions

1.  **Muddle:** Place the chopped basil in the bottom of a tall Collins glass or highball glass. Use a muddler or the back of a spoon to press firmly for 10 seconds.
2.  **Thermal Prep:** Fill the glass to the brim with large ice cubes.
3.  **Combine:** Pour in the gin and the fresh grapefruit juice. Stir twice to integrate.
4.  **Effervescence:** Top with the tonic water or seltzer. Do not stir again—let the bubbles carry the basil essence to the top.
5.  **The Finishing Touch:** Add 3 dashes of bitters directly onto the surface.
6.  **The Slap:** Take the basil sprig, slap it between your palms to release the scent, and tuck it into the ice as a garnish.
