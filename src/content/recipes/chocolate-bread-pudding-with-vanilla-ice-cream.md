## Chef's Note

This is an elevated take on the comfort dessert. By using brioche instead of standard white bread, we ensure a rich, buttery texture that absorbs the custard without falling apart. The key is using both bittersweet and white chocolate to create pockets of intense dark cocoa and creamy sweetness. Let the bread soak for the full 15 minutes for the best texture.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray eight 6-oz ramekins (or a 9x13 baking dish) with non-stick spray.
2.  **The Mix:** In a large bowl, toss the brioche cubes with the chopped bittersweet chocolate and white chocolate chips.
3.  **The Custard:** In a mixer, beat eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, and vanilla until pale. Gradually whisk in the heavy cream and milk until smooth.
4.  **The Soak:** Pour the custard over the bread mixture. Toss gently to coat. **Let stand for 15 minutes** to allow the brioche to hydrate.
5.  **Assemble:** Transfer the mixture to the prepared ramekins, spreading evenly. Drizzle the remaining 4 tbsp of sugar over the tops.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 15-20 minutes until the edges are golden and the custard is set in the center but still has a slight wobble.
7.  **Serve:** Serve warm with a generous scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.
