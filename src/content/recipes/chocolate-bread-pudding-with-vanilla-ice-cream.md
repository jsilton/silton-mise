## Chef's Note
This is a **Modern Heritage** take on the ultimate comfort dessert. By using **Brioche** instead of standard white bread, we ensure a rich, buttery "Bounce" that absorbs the custard without falling apart. The secret to the Silton Standard here is the **Double Chocolate Pattern**: we use both bittersweet and white chocolate to create pockets of intense dark cocoa and creamy sweetness. Let the bread soak for the full 15 minutes—this is mandatory for **Texture Integrity**.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray eight 6-oz ramekins (or a 9x13 baking dish) with non-stick spray.
2.  **The Mix:** In a large bowl, toss the brioche cubes with the chopped bittersweet chocolate and white chocolate chips.
3.  **The Custard:** In a mixer, beat eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, and vanilla until pale. Gradually whisk in the heavy cream and milk until smooth.
4.  **The Soak:** Pour the custard over the bread mixture. Toss gently to coat. **Let stand for 15 minutes** to allow the brioche to hydrate.
5.  **Assemble:** Transfer the mixture to the prepared ramekins, spreading evenly. Drizzle the remaining 4 tbsp of sugar over the tops.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 15-20 minutes until the edges are golden and the custard is set in the center but still has a slight wobble.
7.  **Serve:** Serve warm with a generous scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.
