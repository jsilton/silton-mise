## Chef's Note

This Mexican-inspired salmon dish features a lime-honey glaze that caramelizes during searing, creating a sweet-tangy crust. Using the same pan to build the black bean and corn salad allows the caramelized juices from the fish to infuse the vegetables. Baby spinach is folded in at the end so it wilts without losing its vibrant color.

## Directions

1.  **Aromatics:** In a large skillet, sauté onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, and cumin in 1 tbsp oil for 3 minutes.
2.  **The Glaze:** In a shallow dish, whisk the juice of 1 lime, honey, and chili powder. Coat the salmon fillets in this mixture.
3.  **The Sear:** In a separate non-stick skillet, heat 1 tbsp oil over medium-high. Sear salmon for 5 minutes per side until the honey has created a dark, crispy crust. Cover the pan during the final 2 minutes to ensure it is cooked through.
4.  **The Salad:** To the onion skillet, add the corn and bell peppers. Sauté for 1 minute. Add chicken broth and simmer for 2 minutes. Stir in the black beans until heated through.
5.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Add the second lime's juice, cilantro, and spinach. Toss until the spinach just collapses.
6.  **Serve:** Mound the warm bean salad in bowls and top with the glazed salmon.
