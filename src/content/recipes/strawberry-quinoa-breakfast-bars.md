## Chef's Note

These are breakfast bars for busy mornings. The key to their texture is using pre-cooked quinoa, which introduces protein-rich moisture that prevents the oats from becoming dry and crumbly. By mashing the bananas into a smooth paste before adding the eggs, we create a stable mixture that acts as a healthy binder for the strawberries. The raisins provide a necessary chewy element.

## Directions

1.  **The Emulsion:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with parchment. In a large bowl, mash the bananas until smooth. Whisk in the eggs and vanilla.
2.  **Combine:** Stir in the cooked quinoa, rolled oats, and raisins.
3.  **Fold:** Gently fold in the chopped strawberries. Do not over-mix, or the berries will bleed into the batter.
4.  **Shape:** Transfer the mixture to the prepared dish. Press down firmly with a spatula to create a flat, uniform surface.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 20-25 minutes until the center is firm to the touch and the edges are golden brown.
6.  **Set:** Let cool **completely** in the pan (mandatory for structure). Slice into 9 squares.
