## Chef's Note

This is the definitive Executive holiday dessert. The secret to its incredible Texture is **Culinary Technique** through **The Yolk Emulsion Method**: we whisk the egg yolks into the condensed milk _before_ adding the lime juice. The acid in the juice causes the proteins in the yolks to begin "cooking" instantly, resulting in a dense, velvety set that only requires 15 minutes in the oven. We maintain **Textural Balance** by using a high ratio of butter in the crust to create a shatteringly crisp Crunch that stands up to the creamy filling. Chilling for the full 8 hours is mandatory for the "High Note" acidity to mellow.

## Directions

1.  **The Crust:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Stir together crumbs, sugar, and melted butter until it looks like wet sand. Press firmly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch glass pie plate. Bake for 10 minutes. Let cool.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a large bowl, whisk the condensed milk and egg yolks until pale and thick.
3.  **The Bind:** Slowly whisk in the key lime juice—the mixture will noticeably thicken.
4.  **Bake:** Pour the filling into the cooled crust. Bake for 15 minutes until set around the edges but still having a slight "jiggle" in the center.
5.  **The Finish:** Cool completely on a rack, then refrigerate for **at least 8 hours** (mandatory).
6.  **The Crown:** Just before serving, whip the heavy cream and powdered sugar until stiff peaks form.
7.  **Serve:** Mound the cream over the pie. Garnish with lime zest for the final aromatic **High Note**.
