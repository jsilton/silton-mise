## Chef's Note

This is classic Key lime pie for the holiday table. The key to its texture is whisking the egg yolks into the condensed milk before adding the lime juice. The acid in the juice causes the proteins in the yolks to begin "cooking" instantly, resulting in a dense, velvety set that only requires 15 minutes in the oven. Using a high ratio of butter in the crust creates a shatteringly crisp base that stands up to the creamy filling. Chilling for the full 8 hours is mandatory for the acidity to mellow.

## Directions

1.  **The Crust:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Stir together crumbs, sugar, and melted butter until it looks like wet sand. Press firmly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch glass pie plate. Bake for 10 minutes. Let cool.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a large bowl, whisk the condensed milk and egg yolks until pale and thick.
3.  **The Bind:** Slowly whisk in the key lime juice—the mixture will noticeably thicken.
4.  **Bake:** Pour the filling into the cooled crust. Bake for 15 minutes until set around the edges but still having a slight "jiggle" in the center.
5.  **The Finish:** Cool completely on a rack, then refrigerate for **at least 8 hours** (mandatory).
6.  **The Crown:** Just before serving, whip the heavy cream and powdered sugar until stiff peaks form.
7.  **Serve:** Mound the cream over the pie. Garnish with lime zest for the final aromatic **High Note**.
