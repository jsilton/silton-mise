## Chef's Note

This Sichuan-inspired dish showcases crispy textures with spicy-sour flavors. Dredging eggplant and tofu in cornstarch before frying creates a protective barrier that prevents the eggplant from absorbing too much oil while ensuring maximum crispiness. The sauce balances sweet, savory, and acidic elements—the rice vinegar and lime juice brighten the dish and cut through the heat of Thai bird chiles. Serve immediately for best texture.

## Directions

1.  **Dredge:** In a shallow dish, whisk 2/3 cup cornstarch with salt and pepper. Toss eggplant and tofu cubes in the starch, shaking off excess. They should be completely "dusty."
2.  **The Fry:** Heat 1/2 inch of peanut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the tofu first until golden and crispy (4 mins). Remove to paper towels. Fry the eggplant in batches—do not crowd the pan—until golden brown on all sides.
3.  **The Glaze:** In a small bowl, whisk the broth, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, lime juice, and the remaining 2 tsp cornstarch.
4.  **Aromatics:** Wipe out the skillet, leaving 1 tbsp oil. Sauté ginger, garlic, and chiles for 30 seconds until fragrant. Pour in the glaze mixture.
5.  **Bind:** Simmer for 2 minutes until the sauce thickens into a glossy syrup.
6.  **Toss:** Add the crispy eggplant and tofu back to the pan. Toss vigorously for 30 seconds until every cube is coated. Stir in sesame oil.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve immediately over steamed rice.
