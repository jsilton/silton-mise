## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate hack for technical dish level ribs on a quick timeline. We use the **Pressure Cooker** to achieve fall-off-the-bone tenderness in just 20 minutes, then use the **Broiler** to create the sticky, caramelized lacquer that usually takes hours in a smoker. The secret is the **Reduction**: never throw away the cooking liquid; boil it down to a syrupy glaze to concentrate the ginger and hoisin.

## Directions

1.  **Puree:** In a blender, combine hoisin, soy, molasses, ginger, garlic, and 1/2 cup of the honey. Blend until smooth.
2.  **Pressurize:** Place the ribs in a pressure cooker. Pour the puree over the ribs. Add 1/4 cup water.
3.  **Cook:** Seal and cook on **HIGH PRESSURE** for 20 minutes.
4.  **The Reduction:** Perform a quick pressure release. Transfer the ribs to a foil-lined baking sheet, meaty side up. Pour the liquid from the cooker into a saucepan and boil over high heat for 10 minutes until reduced by half.
5.  **The Lacquer:** Brush the ribs generously with the reduced sauce and the remaining 1/4 cup honey.
6.  **Char:** Broil 6 inches from the heat for 3-5 minutes until the glaze is bubbling and charred at the edges.
7.  **Serve:** Sliced into individual ribs with extra sauce on the side.
