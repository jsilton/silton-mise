## Chef's Note

Honey-glazed spareribs are a Chinese-American restaurant staple. This version uses a pressure cooker to achieve fall-off-the-bone tenderness in 20 minutes instead of hours of smoking or braising. The hoisin-ginger cooking liquid gets boiled down into a concentrated syrupy glaze, then brushed on the ribs before broiling for sticky, caramelized edges. A major time-saver with restaurant-quality results.

## Directions

1.  **Puree:** In a blender, combine hoisin, soy, molasses, ginger, garlic, and 1/2 cup of the honey. Blend until smooth.
2.  **Pressurize:** Place the ribs in a pressure cooker. Pour the puree over the ribs. Add 1/4 cup water.
3.  **Cook:** Seal and cook on **HIGH PRESSURE** for 20 minutes.
4.  **The Reduction:** Perform a quick pressure release. Transfer the ribs to a foil-lined baking sheet, meaty side up. Pour the liquid from the cooker into a saucepan and boil over high heat for 10 minutes until reduced by half.
5.  **The Lacquer:** Brush the ribs generously with the reduced sauce and the remaining 1/4 cup honey.
6.  **Char:** Broil 6 inches from the heat for 3-5 minutes until the glaze is bubbling and charred at the edges.
7.  **Serve:** Sliced into individual ribs with extra sauce on the side.
