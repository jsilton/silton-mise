## Chef's Note

Tinga is a Pueblan dish of shredded meat in smoky chipotle-tomato sauce. The key technique is tatemar—charring tomatoes and garlic directly on a hot skillet or comal to deepen their flavor before blending into a smooth sauce. This creates the characteristic smoky, earthy base. A squeeze of lime at the end brightens the rich, savory flavors.

## Directions

1.  **Char:** Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high. Place halved tomatoes (cut-side down) and unpeeled garlic cloves in the pan. Cook until charred and softened (5-7 mins).
2.  **Blend:** Peel the garlic. Place tomatoes, garlic, chipotles, and adobo sauce in a blender. Puree until smooth.
3.  **Sauté:** Wipe out the pan. Add a splash of oil and sauté the onion half-moons until translucent.
4.  **Simmer:** Pour the blended sauce into the pan. Stir in broth, oregano, and salt. Bring to a simmer for 5 minutes to thicken.
5.  **Toss:** Add the shredded chicken to the sauce. Cook for 5 minutes until the chicken has absorbed the smoky flavors.
6.  **Finish:** Add a squeeze of lime at the end for the **Acid Balance**.
