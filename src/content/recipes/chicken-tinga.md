## Chef's Note

Chicken Tinga is defined by its smoky, earthy sauce. To get the best result without "mushy" vegetables, we use the **Tatemar** technique: charring the tomatoes and garlic first to deepen their flavor before blending them into a smooth, velvety sauce. This is the perfect taco meat for kids—it's saucy, tender, and deeply savory.

## Directions

1.  **Char:** Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high. Place halved tomatoes (cut-side down) and unpeeled garlic cloves in the pan. Cook until charred and softened (5-7 mins).
2.  **Blend:** Peel the garlic. Place tomatoes, garlic, chipotles, and adobo sauce in a blender. Puree until smooth.
3.  **Sauté:** Wipe out the pan. Add a splash of oil and sauté the onion half-moons until translucent.
4.  **Simmer:** Pour the blended sauce into the pan. Stir in broth, oregano, and salt. Bring to a simmer for 5 minutes to thicken.
5.  **Toss:** Add the shredded chicken to the sauce. Cook for 5 minutes until the chicken has absorbed the smoky flavors.
6.  **Finish:** Add a squeeze of lime at the end for the **Acid Balance**.
