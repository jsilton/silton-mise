## Chef's Note

This is a "Traditional Recipe" with a vital modern upgrade. While the original family recipe used Crisco, we have evolved to use high-quality **cold butter**. Butter provides a superior flavor and a better nutritional profile than hydrogenated oils, while the self-rising flour keeps the texture cotton-soft. The "Nana" technique—mixing by hand and flattening by palm—remains the secret to a biscuit that isn't over-worked or tough. It is a humble, soulful side that tastes like home.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Lightly grease a baking sheet with a little butter.
2.  **Cut the Fat:** Place the sifted flour in a large bowl. Add the cold, cubed butter. Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour until it looks like coarse crumbs with some pea-sized bits remaining. (Speed is key to keep the butter cold).
3.  **Hydrate:** Add the buttermilk and the pinch of baking soda. Mix gently with your hand just until the dough comes together. If it's too dry, add a tablespoon more buttermilk; if too sticky, a dusting of flour.
4.  **Shape:** Roll the dough into 12 small balls. Place on the greased cookie sheet and flatten slightly with the palm of your hand. This flat shape ensures a crispy exterior and a tender middle.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 10-12 minutes. If the tops are not golden brown, switch to **Broil** for 1 minute, watching intensely to prevent burning.
