## Chef's Note

The secret to a restaurant-quality stew is **The Batched Sear**. Never crowd the pan; if you add all the meat at once, it will steam and turn gray. By searing in batches, you build a deep, dark "fond" on the bottom of the pot which provides the savory foundation for the entire dish. We finish with a splash of **Balsamic Vinegar** to provide the high note that cuts the heavy beef fat.

## Directions

1.  **Dredge:** Season beef cubes with salt and pepper. Toss in flour and shake off excess.
2.  **The Sear:** Heat oil in a large Dutch oven. Sear beef in 3 batches until a dark brown crust forms on all sides. Remove to a plate.
3.  **The Base:** Add pancetta to the pot and cook until crisp. Add onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté for 8 minutes until soft.
4.  **Bloom:** Stir in garlic and tomato paste. Fry for 2 minutes until the paste is dark red.
5.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the red wine. Scrape the bottom of the pot to release all those browned bits. Boil for 5 minutes to reduce.
6.  **Simmer:** Return the beef to the pot. Add stock and thyme. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook on **LOW** for 2 hours.
7.  **Potatoes:** Add the potatoes. Cover and cook for another 45 minutes until meat and potatoes are tender.
8.  **Finish:** Stir in the peas and balsamic vinegar. Taste and adjust salt. Serve hot.
