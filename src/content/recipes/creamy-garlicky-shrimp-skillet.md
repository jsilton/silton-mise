## Chef's Note

This is a 25-minute quick classic that avoids the common "greasy sauce" problem. The secret is the **Shrimp Snap Method**: we sear the shrimp briefly and remove them, allowing us to build the sauce without overcooking the protein. We use **The Emulsion Method**: by whisking the starchy pasta water into the heavy cream and Parmesan, we create a stable, glossy bind that clings to the fettuccine. The roasted peppers provide the necessary **High Note** of sweetness to cut the garlic.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook fettuccine in salted water for 1 minute **less** than package directions. **Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water** before draining.
2.  **The Base:** In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Sauté sliced garlic, roasted peppers, and paprika for 2 minutes until the butter is fragrant and red.
3.  **Simmer:** Pour in the heavy cream. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 3-4 minutes until slightly thickened.
4.  **Snap:** Add the shrimp to the sauce. Cook for 2-3 minutes until pink and just opaque.
5.  **Bind:** Add the hot pasta and Parmesan to the skillet. Pour in the reserved pasta water.
6.  **Toss:** Toss vigorously over medium-low heat for 1-2 minutes until the cheese is melted and the sauce is glossy.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with fresh parsley and plenty of black pepper.
