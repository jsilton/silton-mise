## Chef's Note

This is an Italian-American cream sauce pasta with shrimp, popular in red sauce Italian restaurants from the 1980s onward. The key is not overcooking the shrimp - sear them briefly until just pink, then remove them while you build the sauce. Pasta water is essential here: its starch helps the cream and Parmesan emulsify into a stable, glossy sauce that coats the fettuccine rather than separating into greasy pools. The roasted red peppers add sweetness and a hint of smoke that balances the rich garlic and cream. Smoked paprika reinforces that flavor.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook fettuccine in salted water for 1 minute **less** than package directions. **Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water** before draining.
2.  **The Base:** In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Sauté sliced garlic, roasted peppers, and paprika for 2 minutes until the butter is fragrant and red.
3.  **Simmer:** Pour in the heavy cream. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 3-4 minutes until slightly thickened.
4.  **Snap:** Add the shrimp to the sauce. Cook for 2-3 minutes until pink and just opaque.
5.  **Bind:** Add the hot pasta and Parmesan to the skillet. Pour in the reserved pasta water.
6.  **Toss:** Toss vigorously over medium-low heat for 1-2 minutes until the cheese is melted and the sauce is glossy.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with fresh parsley and plenty of black pepper.
