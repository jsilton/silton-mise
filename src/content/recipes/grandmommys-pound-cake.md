## Chef's Note

The pound cake is a heritage recipe perfected over generations. We have eliminated the legacy margarine entirely, using only unsalted butter to achieve the golden crumb. The key is baking at 275°F for a full 90 minutes; this ensures the cake rises evenly without a tough outer crust, resulting in a dense, velvety texture that defines a true pound cake. Room temperature eggs are mandatory for a perfect emulsion.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 275°F. Generously grease and flour a large Bundt pan or three 9x5 loaf pans.
2.  **Cream:** In a stand mixer, cream the butter and sugar on medium-high for 5-7 minutes until the mixture is pale, light, and doubled in volume.
3.  **Emulsify:** Add the eggs one at a time, beating for 30 seconds after each addition to ensure a stable structure.
4.  **Incorporate:** Reduce speed to low. Gradually add the pre-sifted flour in three parts, mixing until **just combined**.
5.  **Flavor:** Fold in the lemon, almond, and vanilla extracts by hand.
6.  **Bake:** Pour the thick batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 275°F for 1.5 hours (or at 300°F for 1 hour if using loaf pans) until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
7.  **Cool:** Let cool in the pan for 20 minutes before inverting onto a rack.
