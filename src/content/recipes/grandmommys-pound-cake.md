## Chef's Note

The pound cake is the ultimate expression of **Updated Classic**. We have eliminated the legacy margarine entirely, using only **Unsalted Butter** to achieve the mandatory "Golden Crumb." The secret to the Kitchen Standard is **The Low-Heat Bake Method**: by baking at 275°F for a full 90 minutes, we ensure the cake rises evenly without a tough outer crust, resulting in a dense, velvety Texture that defines a true heritage pound cake. Room temperature eggs are mandatory for a perfect emulsion.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 275°F. Generously grease and flour a large Bundt pan or three 9x5 loaf pans.
2.  **Cream:** In a stand mixer, cream the butter and sugar on medium-high for 5-7 minutes until the mixture is pale, light, and doubled in volume.
3.  **Emulsify:** Add the eggs one at a time, beating for 30 seconds after each addition to ensure a stable structure.
4.  **Incorporate:** Reduce speed to low. Gradually add the pre-sifted flour in three parts, mixing until **just combined**.
5.  **Flavor:** Fold in the lemon, almond, and vanilla extracts by hand.
6.  **Bake:** Pour the thick batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 275°F for 1.5 hours (or at 300°F for 1 hour if using loaf pans) until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
7.  **Cool:** Let cool in the pan for 20 minutes before inverting onto a rack.
