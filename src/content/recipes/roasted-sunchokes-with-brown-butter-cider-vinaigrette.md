## Chef's Note

Sunchokes are the ultimate "Modern Heritage" root vegetable. The secret to their Success is **Texture Integrity** through **The 60-Minute Roast**: they require a long, high-heat dwell time to transform their starch into a creamy, artichoke-like "Bounce." We use **The Beurre Noisette Pattern**: browning the butter before whisking it into the reduced cider vinegar creates a savory-sweet glaze with a nutty "Snap." The reduction of the vinegar is the mandatory **Acid Finish** that cuts through the earthy sunchokes.

## Directions

1.  **Roast:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Toss sunchokes with oil, thyme, garlic, and salt. Roast for 1 hour, flipping once, until golden and fork-tender. Discard herbs/garlic.
2.  **Reduce:** In a small pan, simmer cider vinegar until reduced to 2 tbsp (about 3 mins). Stir in shallots, honey, and chili flakes.
3.  **Brown Butter:** In the same pan, melt butter over medium heat. Cook for 3 minutes until foamy and dark brown. Whisk immediately into the vinegar mixture.
4.  **Bind:** Toss the hot sunchokes with the fresh spinach—the heat will wilt the leaves perfectly.
5.  **Finish:** Drizzle with the brown butter vinaigrette and top with chives for the mandatory **High Note**.
