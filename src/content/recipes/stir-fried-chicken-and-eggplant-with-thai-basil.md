## Chef's Note

The secret to this nutritious stir-fry is **Textural Balance** through **The Eggplant Sweat Method**. You must salt the diced eggplant and let it stand in a colander for 20 minutes; this draws out the bitter moisture and ensures the eggplant develops a crispy charred exterior rather than turning into a sponge. We use **The Mortar-and-Pestle Method**: mashing the garlic and chiles into a paste ensures the heat is evenly emulsified throughout the **Fish Sauce Glaze**, providing a balanced Texture in every bite.

## Directions

1.  **The Sweat:** Salt the eggplant generously. Let stand in a colander for 20 minutes. Rinse and pat **bone-dry** with a towel.
2.  **The Paste:** Mash the garlic, chiles, and ginger into a coarse paste using a mortar or small bowl.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok until smoking. Add the garlic paste and chicken. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until no pink remains. Remove to a plate.
4.  **The Crunch:** Add 1 tbsp oil. Sauté the dry eggplant for 10 minutes until golden and charred.
5.  **Bind:** Return the chicken to the wok. Add the fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and 1/4 cup water.
6.  **Finish:** Cover and steam for 2 minutes. Uncover, stir in the basil leaves, and toss for 30 seconds until just wilted.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately over steamed jasmine rice.
