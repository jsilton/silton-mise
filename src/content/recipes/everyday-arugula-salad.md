## Chef's Note

This is a simple, versatile side salad. The secret to avoiding a wilted, soggy salad is proper dressing technique: never pour oil and lemon directly onto the leaves. Instead, drizzle them around the inner rim of the bowl and toss from the bottom up. This ensures a thin, even coating that keeps the greens crisp and peppery. The lemon adds essential brightness that cuts through any rich main course.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Place the baby arugula in a large, wide wooden or ceramic bowl.
2.  **Drizzle:** Drizzle the olive oil around the perimeter of the bowl. Repeat with the fresh lemon juice.
3.  **Season:** Sprinkle with flaky salt and a generous amount of cracked black pepper.
4.  **Toss:** Using your hands or large tongs, toss gently until every leaf is lightly glossy and the seasonings are evenly distributed.
5.  **Finish:** Top with the shaved Parmesan curls. Serve immediately—this salad waits for no one.
