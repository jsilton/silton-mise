## Description

The universal side dish. The peppery bite of arugula and the acid of lemon juice cut through rich, fatty mains like pasta or breaded chicken.

## Directions

1.  Place arugula in a large wide bowl.
2.  Drizzle the olive oil around the sides of the bowl (not directly on the greens to avoid wilting). Drizzle the lemon juice the same way.
3.  Sprinkle with salt and generous cracked pepper.
4.  Toss gently with your hands until every leaf is lightly glossy. Taste and adjust acid/salt.
5.  Top with shaved Parmesan curls. Serve immediately.
