## Chef's Note

Creamy tortellini soup is comfort food that became popular in American slow-cooker cooking during the 2000s. Making a quick roux in the microwave with flour, onions, and tomato paste gives the soup body from the start, so it doesn't turn out thin and watery. Add the tortellini and cream only in the final 10 minutes to prevent the pasta from getting mushy and the cream from curdling.

## Directions

1.  **The Roux:** In a microwave-safe bowl, combine onion, flour, basil, garlic, and tomato paste with 3 tbsp oil. Microwave for 5 minutes, stirring every 90 seconds, until a thick paste forms.
2.  **Combine:** Add the onion paste, broth, tomatoes, and chicken to the slow cooker. Stir to dissolve.
3.  **Slow Cook:** Cover and cook on **Low for 4-6 hours** (or High for 3) until the chicken is tender.
4.  **The Pull:** Remove chicken and shred into bite-sized pieces. Return to the pot.
5.  **The Bind:** Stir in the frozen tortellini, fresh spinach, Parmesan, and **warmed heavy cream**.
6.  **Finish:** Cover and cook on High for 10 more minutes until the pasta is al dente and the spinach has collapsed.
7.  **Serve:** Ladle into bowls and top with an extra "High Note" of black pepper.
