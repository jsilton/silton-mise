## Chef's Note
The secret to a slow-cooker soup that isn't thin and watery is **Structural Science** through **The Microwave Roux Pattern**. We "cook" the onions, flour, and tomato paste in the microwave first to create a toasted, thick paste before it hits the pot; this ensures the soup has a rich "Bounce" from the start. We maintain **Texture Integrity** by adding the tortellini and heavy cream only in the final 10 minutes—this ensures the pasta stays "Snappy" and the cream doesn't curdle.

## Directions

1.  **The Roux:** In a microwave-safe bowl, combine onion, flour, basil, garlic, and tomato paste with 3 tbsp oil. Microwave for 5 minutes, stirring every 90 seconds, until a thick paste forms.
2.  **Combine:** Add the onion paste, broth, tomatoes, and chicken to the slow cooker. Stir to dissolve.
3.  **Slow Cook:** Cover and cook on **Low for 4-6 hours** (or High for 3) until the chicken is tender.
4.  **The Pull:** Remove chicken and shred into bite-sized pieces. Return to the pot.
5.  **The Bind:** Stir in the frozen tortellini, fresh spinach, Parmesan, and **warmed heavy cream**. 
6.  **Finish:** Cover and cook on High for 10 more minutes until the pasta is al dente and the spinach has collapsed.
7.  **Serve:** Ladle into bowls and top with an extra "High Note" of black pepper.
