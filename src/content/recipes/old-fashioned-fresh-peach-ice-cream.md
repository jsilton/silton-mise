## Chef's Note

For fruit ice cream without icy chunks, macerate peaches in lemon juice and sugar for 30 minutes before mashing—this draws out natural juices and creates syrup that prevents fruit from freezing solid. Tempering egg yolks with hot cream creates rich, stable custard that provides silky mouthfeel. Add mashed fruit in the final 30 seconds of churning to maintain texture.

## Directions

1.  **Macerate:** Toss peeled peaches with 1/2 cup sugar and lemon juice. Let stand for 1 hour. Mash into a coarse syrup. Drain and reserve the liquid.
2.  **Custard:** In a saucepan, heat cream, milk, and 1/2 cup sugar until steaming.
3.  **Emulsify:** Whisk yolks with 1/4 cup sugar. Slowly whisk in 1 cup of hot cream to temper. Return everything to the pan.
4.  **Cook:** Stir over medium-low heat until the custard reaches 175°F and coats a spoon. Stir in vanilla.
5.  **Chill:** Strain into a bowl. Whisk in the peach syrup. Refrigerate for **at least 4 hours** until stone-cold.
6.  **Churn:** Pour into ice cream maker. Churn until soft-serve consistency. Fold in the mashed peaches during the last 30 seconds.
7.  **Set:** Freeze for 4-6 hours to ripen the texture.
