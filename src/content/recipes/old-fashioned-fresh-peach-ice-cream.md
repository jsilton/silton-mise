## Chef's Note

The secret to "Kitchen Standard" fruit ice cream is **The Maceration Method**. You must toss the peaches in lemon juice and sugar for 30 minutes before mashing; this draws out the natural juices and creates a syrup that prevents the fruit from freezing into icy chunks. We use **The Yolk Emulsion Method**: by tempering the egg yolks with hot cream, we create a rich, stable custard Texture that provides a silky mouthfeel. Always add the mashed fruit in the final 30 seconds of churning to maintain **Textural Balance**.

## Directions

1.  **Macerate:** Toss peeled peaches with 1/2 cup sugar and lemon juice. Let stand for 1 hour. Mash into a coarse syrup. Drain and reserve the liquid.
2.  **Custard:** In a saucepan, heat cream, milk, and 1/2 cup sugar until steaming.
3.  **Emulsify:** Whisk yolks with 1/4 cup sugar. Slowly whisk in 1 cup of hot cream to temper. Return everything to the pan.
4.  **Cook:** Stir over medium-low heat until the custard reaches 175°F and coats a spoon. Stir in vanilla.
5.  **Chill:** Strain into a bowl. Whisk in the peach syrup. Refrigerate for **at least 4 hours** until stone-cold.
6.  **Churn:** Pour into ice cream maker. Churn until soft-serve consistency. Fold in the mashed peaches during the last 30 seconds.
7.  **Set:** Freeze for 4-6 hours to ripen the texture.
