## Chef's Note

This is the "Secret Weapon" chili for families. The **Sweet Potatoes** serve a dual purpose: they provide a natural sweetness that kids love, and as they simmer, they release starches that thicken the chili into a rich, hearty stew without needing a flour roux. By using ground turkey and black beans, we keep it high-protein and lower in saturated fat than traditional beef chili. Always finish with **Apple Cider Vinegar** or **Lime**—the acid is the "high note" that makes the earthy spices pop.

## Directions

1.  **Brown the Meat:** In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add the ground turkey and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through.
2.  **Sauté Aromatics:** Add the diced onion and sweet potato cubes. Cook for 5–7 minutes until the onions are translucent and the sweet potatoes start to soften at the edges.
3.  **The Bloom:** Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, and smoked paprika. Stir constantly for 1 minute until the spices are fragrant and coating the meat and veg. (This "blooming" step releases the oil-soluble flavors).
4.  **The Simmer:** Pour in the crushed tomatoes, chicken broth, and Better Than Bouillon. Stir well, scraping the bottom of the pot to release any "fond."
5.  **Beans:** Add the drained beans. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low.
6.  **Low & Slow:** Cover and simmer for 30–40 minutes. The sweet potatoes should be very tender, and some should have started to "melt" into the sauce.
7.  **The Finish:** Stir in the apple cider vinegar (or lime juice). Taste and add salt or pepper as needed.
8.  **Serve:** Ladle into bowls and let everyone customize with their favorite toppings.
