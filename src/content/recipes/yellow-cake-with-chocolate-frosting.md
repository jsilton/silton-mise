## Chef's Note

This is the definitive birthday cake for the family. The secret is using both softened butter (for structure) and liquid oil (to keep it moist), which creates a cake that is rich but never dry. We use extra egg yolks to introduce more lecithin, resulting in a dense, velvety texture usually only found in professional bakeries. The buttermilk provides the acidity needed to balance the sweet chocolate frosting.

## Directions

1.  **Cream:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Line two 9-inch cake pans with parchment. Beat butter and sugar for 3 minutes until pale. Whisk in the oil.
2.  **Emulsify:** Add eggs and yolks **one at a time**, then vanilla.
3.  **Dry Mix:** Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt.
4.  **Incorporate:** Alternately add the dry mix and the buttermilk to the butter, beginning and ending with the dry. **Do not over-mix.**
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 25 minutes until a tester comes out with moist crumbs. Let cool **completely** before inverting.
6.  **Frosting:** Whisk melted butter and cocoa. Beat in the sugar, milk, and vanilla for 5 minutes until light and billowy.
7.  **Finish:** Frost the layers heavily. Garnish with a "High Note" of flaky sea salt if desired.
