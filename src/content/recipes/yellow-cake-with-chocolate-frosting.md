## Chef's Note
This is the definitive "Birthday Standard" for the Silton family. The secret to its Success is **The Fat-Hybrid Pattern**: by using both softened butter (for the "Bounce") and liquid oil (for the "Moisture Guard"), we achieve a cake that is rich but never dry. We use **Extra Egg Yolks** to introduce more lecithin, resulting in a dense, velvety structure usually only found in professional bakeries. The buttermilk provide the mandatory **Acid Finish** needed to balance the sweet **Chocolate Silk Frosting**.

## Directions

1.  **Cream:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Line two 9-inch cake pans with parchment. Beat butter and sugar for 3 minutes until pale. Whisk in the oil.
2.  **Emulsify:** Add eggs and yolks **one at a time**, then vanilla. 
3.  **Dry Mix:** Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt. 
4.  **Incorporate:** Alternately add the dry mix and the buttermilk to the butter, beginning and ending with the dry. **Do not over-mix.**
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 25 minutes until a tester comes out with moist crumbs. Let cool **completely** before inverting.
6.  **Frosting:** Whisk melted butter and cocoa. Beat in the sugar, milk, and vanilla for 5 minutes until light and billowy (The Silk Standard).
7.  **Finish:** Frost the layers heavily. Garnish with a "High Note" of flaky sea salt if desired.
