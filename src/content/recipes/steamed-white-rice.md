## Chef's Note

Fundamental to Korean and Japanese tables, short-grain rice (often called sushi rice) is stickier and starchier than long-grain varieties like Jasmine or Basmati. The goal is distinct, chewy grains that clump slightly—perfect for chopsticks. The most critical step is washing the rice until the water runs clear; this removes excess starch that causes gloopiness.

## Directions

1.  **Wash:** Place rice in a pot and cover with cold water. Swirl with your hand, drain the cloudy water, and repeat 3-4 times until water is mostly clear. Drain well in a sieve.
2.  **Soak (Optional):** For perfect texture, let the drained rice sit in the pot with the measured cooking water for 20-30 minutes before turning on the heat.
3.  **Boil:** Bring the pot (rice + water) to a boil over medium-high heat. Do not cover yet.
4.  **Simmer:** Once boiling, cover with a tight-fitting lid. Reduce heat to the absolute lowest setting. Simmer for 15 minutes. **Do not peek.**
5.  **Steam:** Turn off the heat. Move the pot off the burner. Let it sit, covered, for another 10 minutes. This steaming step finishes the cooking evenly.
6.  **Fluff:** Open the lid and fluff gently with a paddle or fork to release excess moisture.
