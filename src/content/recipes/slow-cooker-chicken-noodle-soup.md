## Chef's Note

Adding pasta during the final 40 minutes of the slow-cook cycle prevents it from dissolving into the broth—a common problem when noodles cook for hours. Fresh lemon juice stirred in at the end transforms a heavy stew into a bright, restorative soup by cutting through the rich chicken and vegetables with tangy acidity.

## Directions

1.  **Foundation:** Place chicken, stock, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and dried herbs in a 6-quart slow cooker. Season with salt and pepper.
2.  **Slow Cook:** Cover and cook on **Low for 6-8 hours** until the chicken is fork-tender.
3.  **The Pull:** Remove the chicken. Use two forks to shred it into large chunks. Return to the pot.
4.  **The Pasta:** Stir in the dry noodles. Cover and cook on **Low for 30-40 minutes** until the pasta is perfectly al dente.
5.  **Finish:** Stir in the lemon juice and fresh parsley.
6.  **Serve:** Ladle into massive bowls. Serve immediately to maintain **Textural Balance**.
