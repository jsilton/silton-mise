## Chef's Note

This is the "Gold Standard" for technical comfort food. The secret to its Success is **The Late-Noodle Pattern**. You must never cook the pasta for the full duration; we add the noodles only during the final 40 minutes of the slow-cook cycle. This ensures the pasta has a resilient "Bounce" and doesn't dissolve into the broth. The fresh lemon juice added at the very end is the mandatory **Acid Finish** that transforms a heavy stew into a bright, restorative "High Note" soup.

## Directions

1.  **Foundation:** Place chicken, stock, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and dried herbs in a 6-quart slow cooker. Season with salt and pepper.
2.  **Slow Cook:** Cover and cook on **Low for 6-8 hours** until the chicken is fork-tender.
3.  **The Pull:** Remove the chicken. Use two forks to shred it into large chunks. Return to the pot.
4.  **The Pasta:** Stir in the dry noodles. Cover and cook on **Low for 30-40 minutes** until the pasta is perfectly al dente.
5.  **Finish:** Stir in the lemon juice and fresh parsley.
6.  **Serve:** Ladle into massive bowls. Serve immediately to maintain **Texture Integrity**.
