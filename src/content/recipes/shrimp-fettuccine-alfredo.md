## Chef's Note

This is an American combination of Italian fettuccine Alfredo with seafood, popularized by Italian-American restaurants in the mid-20th century. [Real Alfredo Sauce](/mise/recipes/real-alfredo-sauce) was created in 1908 by Alfredo di Lelio in Rome using only butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano - Americans later added cream to make it richer and more stable. The key with shrimp is a quick high-heat sear for about 2 minutes per side so they get some color but stay juicy inside - overcooking makes them rubbery. If making the sauce from scratch, be sure to scrape up any browned shrimp bits from the pan as they add tremendous flavor to the butter and cheese.

## Directions

1.  **Pasta:** Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Cook fettuccine according to package directions. **Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining.**
2.  **Shrimp:** While pasta boils, toss shrimp with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
3.  **Sear:** Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear shrimp for 2 minutes per side until pink and opaque. Remove to a plate.
4.  **Sauce:**
    - If using **[Real Alfredo Sauce](/mise/recipes/real-alfredo-sauce)**: Prepare it in the same skillet used for the shrimp (scrape up those browned bits!).
    - If using **Jarred Sauce**: Pour into the skillet and heat until bubbling.
5.  **Combine:** Toss the hot pasta and the seared shrimp into the sauce. If it's too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.
6.  **Garnish:** Top with fresh parsley and serve immediately.
