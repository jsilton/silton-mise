## Chef's Note

Shrimp and Alfredo are a match made in comfort-food heaven. The key to the shrimp is a **High-Heat Sear**: you want them to have a little color but stay juicy inside. If you have the extra 5 minutes, making the [Real Alfredo Sauce](/silton-mise/recipes/real-alfredo-sauce) from scratch will transform this from a basic dinner into a restaurant-quality feast.

## Directions

1.  **Pasta:** Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Cook fettuccine according to package directions. **Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining.**
2.  **Shrimp:** While pasta boils, toss shrimp with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
3.  **Sear:** Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear shrimp for 2 minutes per side until pink and opaque. Remove to a plate.
4.  **Sauce:**
    - If using **[Real Alfredo Sauce](/silton-mise/recipes/real-alfredo-sauce)**: Prepare it in the same skillet used for the shrimp (scrape up those browned bits!).
    - If using **Jarred Sauce**: Pour into the skillet and heat until bubbling.
5.  **Combine:** Toss the hot pasta and the seared shrimp into the sauce. If it's too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.
6.  **Garnish:** Top with fresh parsley and serve immediately.
