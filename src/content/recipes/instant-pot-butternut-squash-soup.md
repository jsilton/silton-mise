## Chef's Note

Sautéing bacon first, removing it for garnish, then cooking aromatics in the rendered fat infuses this soup with smoky umami backbone. Including a Granny Smith apple prevents the squash from becoming overly sweet—the apple's acidity balances the soup's natural sugars and provides brightness within the puree itself.

## Directions

1.  **The Render:** Set the Instant Pot to "Sauté" (High). Add diced bacon and cook until crispy (6-8 mins). Remove bacon to a plate, leaving the fat in the pot.
2.  **Aromatics:** Add onion to the bacon fat. Sauté for 3 minutes until translucent. Stir in garlic, sage, and thyme; cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
3.  **Pressure:** Stir in the squash, carrots, celery, and chopped apple. Pour in the chicken stock and season with salt and pepper.
4.  **Cook:** Secure the lid. Set to **High Pressure for 12 minutes**.
5.  **Release:** Perform a "quick Release" of the pressure. Remove and discard the thyme sprigs.
6.  **The Emulsion:** Stir in the heavy cream. Using an immersion blender, puree the soup directly in the pot until completely velvety and smooth.
7.  **Serve:** Ladle into bowls. Garnish with the reserved crispy bacon and chives for the mandatory **Textural Snap**.
