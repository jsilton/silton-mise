## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate test of **Culinary Technique** in baking. The secret to the Kitchen Standard is the **24-Hour Chill Method**: you must refrigerate the dough for at least 24 hours before baking. This allows the flour to fully hydrate and the sugars to begin breaking down, resulting in a cookie with a deep, toffee-like complexity and a superior Crunch on the edges. We use **Dutch-process Cocoa** for its darker, smoother profile and mandatory **Chocolate Discs** to create wide "pools" of chocolate rather than small nuggets.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, salt, baking powder, and baking soda until no lumps remain.
2.  **Cream:** In a stand mixer, beat butter and both sugars for exactly 5 minutes until very light and aerated. Add the egg and vanilla; beat until combined.
3.  **Combine:** On low speed, add the dry ingredients and mix until **just combined**. Fold in the chocolate discs.
4.  **The Chill:** Press plastic wrap directly against the dough. Refrigerate for **at least 24 hours** (36 hours is the Kitchen Standard).
5.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
6.  **Portion:** Form the cold dough into balls larger than golf balls (about 3.5 oz each). Place only 5 balls per sheet, as they will spread significantly.
7.  **Bake:** Bake for 18 minutes until the edges are set but the center still looks slightly soft.
8.  **Cool:** Let cool on the sheet for 10 minutes to allow the internal structure to firm up.
