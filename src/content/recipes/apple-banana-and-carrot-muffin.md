## Directions

1. Watch the quick recipe video before you get started, scroll up a little to find it
2. Check the notes at the bottom of the recipe for little bits of extra info and help
3. Peel and grate carrot, place apple and carrot in a pot with a little water, pop a lid on and simmer until apple soft. Usually 5-6 mins
4. While apple and carrot cooking, place banana in a large bowl, mash with a fork
5. Add eggs, vanilla, and butter/oil
6. Puree the cooked apple and carrot, I use a stick blender
7. Add apple and carrot to the other wet ingredients
8. Beat these wet ingredients together with a hand-held beater, should become smooth, yellow and a little frothy
9. Add the flour and baking powder
10. Beat for a further 30-60 seconds to make a well-mixed batter
11. Portion into an oiled muffin tin (I use a non-stick silicon tray sprayed with oil) Mix makes 12 standard sized muffins or 30 mini muffins
12. Bake at 180 degrees Celsius for 15 mins (350 Fahrenheit) 15 min cook time is based on making mini muffins, the mix makes approx 30 mini muffins. If you are using a standard muffin tray and making approx 12 muffins the cook time will be longer, approx 25-30 mins
13. Cool
14. Serve
15. These muffins can be stored in an airtight container for 3 days, or they can be frozen.

## Notes

This recipe is successful without the butter/oil, but you getter a softer muffin with it, and they remain softer for longer with the added butter or oilTo make the recipe dairy free, substitute the melted butter for a mild tasting vegetable oil.15 min cook time is based on making mini muffins, the mix makes approx 30 mini muffins. If you are using a standard muffin tray and making approx 12 muffins the cook time will be longer, approx 25-30 mins
