## Chef's Note

The common flaw in "Healthy" muffins is a gummy, dense texture. We solve this by **Grating, not Simmering**. The original recipe suggested boiling the apple and carrot; we have upgraded this to fresh grating. This preserves the structural integrity of the fruit and veg, providing a lighter crumb and a fresher flavor profile. Note: this recipe is crafted for children—keep toppings simple, avoid nuts for young eaters, and skip delicate herb garnishes.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
2.  **The Veg:** Grate the apple and carrot using the fine holes of a box grater. Squeeze out any excess juice (drink it!).
3.  **Wet:** In a large bowl, whisk the mashed banana, eggs, melted butter, vanilla, grated apple, and grated carrot.
4.  **Dry:** In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.
5.  **Fold:** Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet until **just combined**. Do not over-mix, or the muffins will be tough.
6.  **Bake:** Portion into the tin. Bake for 20-25 minutes (standard) or 15 minutes (mini) until a tester comes out clean.
7.  **Rest:** Cool on a wire rack.
