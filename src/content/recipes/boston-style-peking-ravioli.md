## Chef's Note

This is not a delicate potsticker; this is a **Boston Peking Ravioli**. It is defined by its thick, chewy, almost pasta-like skin and a bottom that is fried to a deep, dark golden brown. The secret to the dough is using **Boiling Water** (hot water crust method)—this partially cooks the flour, resulting in a wrapper that stays soft and chewy even after frying. The sauce must be ginger-forward and slightly sweet to mimic the legendary versions from Bernard's and Golden Temple.

## Directions

### The Thick Wrappers

1.  **Mix:** Place flour in a bowl. Slowly pour in the boiling water while stirring with chopsticks until a shaggy dough forms.
2.  **Knead:** Knead for 5-8 minutes until smooth. Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 30 minutes.
3.  **Roll:** Divide into small balls. Roll each into a circle about 3.5 inches wide. They should be significantly thicker than a standard wonton wrapper (about 1/8 inch).

### The Filling

1.  **Squeeze:** Ensure the minced cabbage is salted and squeezed in a towel to remove ALL moisture. (Watery cabbage = soggy ravioli).
2.  **Mix:** Combine all filling ingredients. Stir vigorously in one direction for 3 minutes until the meat is sticky and emulsified.

### Assembly

1.  Place a large tablespoon of filling in each wrapper.
2.  Fold in half and pleat only 3-4 times (the Boston style is more rustic and "chunky" than delicate). Press hard to seal.

### The "Boston Fry"

1.  **Sear:** Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large flat-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Place ravioli in the pan and fry undisturbed for 2-3 minutes until the bottoms are dark golden.
2.  **Steam:** Pour in 1/2 cup of water and immediately cover with a tight lid. Reduce heat to medium and steam for 6-8 minutes until the water is gone.
3.  **Crisp:** Remove lid. Add 1 more tsp of oil. Fry for 1 more minute until the bottoms "crackle" and are perfectly crisp.
