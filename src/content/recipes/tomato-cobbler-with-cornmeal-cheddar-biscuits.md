## Chef's Note
This is a masterclass in **Texture Integrity**. The secret to Success is **The Caramelized Onion Bind Pattern**: we sauté the red onions for a full 20 minutes until they become a sweet, jammy paste *before* adding the cherry tomatoes. This creates a rich "Bounce" base that holds the whole tomatoes in suspension. We use **Structural Science** for the biscuits: the addition of cornmeal provides a gritty "Snap" that contrasts the velvety tomatoes. The red wine provides the mandatory **Acid Finish** to cut the rich cheddar crust.

## Directions

1.  **Reduction:** In a massive skillet, sauté onions in oil for 20 minutes until mahogany brown. Add garlic and wine; simmer until the wine has vanished.
2.  **The Paste:** Stir in 1/4 cup flour until paste-like. Remove from heat. Gently fold in the cherry tomatoes and salt. Pour into a large baking dish.
3.  **The Dough:** In a food processor, pulse flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and cold butter until pea-sized. Transfer to a bowl.
4.  **Emulsify:** Stir in 1 cup of the cheese and the buttermilk until a shaggy, sticky dough forms.
5.  **Drop:** Spoon walnut-sized mounds of dough over the tomatoes—you want gaps for the steam to escape (The Steam Cycle).
6.  **Bake:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Bake for 55-60 minutes until the tomatoes are bubbling and the biscuits are deep golden.
7.  **The Snap:** During the final 10 minutes, sprinkle the remaining cheese over the biscuits.
8.  **Set:** Let rest for 15 minutes (mandatory) before serving.
