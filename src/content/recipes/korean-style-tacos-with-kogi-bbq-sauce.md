## Chef's Note
This dish is a masterclass in **Modularity**. The secret to "Street Standard" tacos is **The Kogi Emulsion Pattern**: we whisk gochujang and sesame oil into a stable glaze that binds instantly to pre-cooked proteins. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The Quick Pickle Snap**: you must slice the cucumbers paper-thin and let them sit in vinegar for exactly 1 hour; this creates a translucent, "bouncy" crunch that provides the mandatory **Acid Finish** to cut through the sweet BBQ sauce.

## Directions

1.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together the Gochujang, sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, and sesame oil until smooth. Set aside.
2.  **The Pickle:** In a separate bowl, toss cucumber slices with vinegar, sugar, chili, and salt. **Refrigerate for at least 1 hour** (but no more than 3) to maintain the "Snap."
3.  **The Sear:** Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add the cooked pork or chicken and 1/4 cup of the Kogi sauce. Toss vigorously for 3-4 minutes until the edges are crispy and the meat is lacquered.
4.  **Toast:** Warm the tortillas over an open flame or in a dry pan until charred in spots.
5.  **Assemble:** Place a generous scoop of the glazed meat into each tortilla. 
6.  **Finish:** Top with a pile of the chilled cucumber pickles and extra scallions. Serve immediately.
