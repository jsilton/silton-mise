## Chef's Note

These Korean-Mexican fusion tacos were popularized by LA's Kogi BBQ truck in 2008, combining Korean gochujang-based sauce with traditional Mexican tortillas. The sauce whisks together gochujang, sesame oil, soy sauce, and sugar into a sweet-spicy glaze. Paper-thin cucumbers quick-pickled in vinegar for an hour provide a cool, tangy crunch that balances the rich sauce.

## Directions

1.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together the Gochujang, sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, and sesame oil until smooth. Set aside.
2.  **The Pickle:** In a separate bowl, toss cucumber slices with vinegar, sugar, chili, and salt. **Refrigerate for at least 1 hour** (but no more than 3) to maintain the "Snap."
3.  **The Sear:** Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add the cooked pork or chicken and 1/4 cup of the Kogi sauce. Toss vigorously for 3-4 minutes until the edges are crispy and the meat is lacquered.
4.  **Toast:** Warm the tortillas over an open flame or in a dry pan until charred in spots.
5.  **Assemble:** Place a generous scoop of the glazed meat into each tortilla.
6.  **Finish:** Top with a pile of the chilled cucumber pickles and extra scallions. Serve immediately.
