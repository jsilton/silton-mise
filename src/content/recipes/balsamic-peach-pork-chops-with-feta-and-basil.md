## Directions

1. 1. Preheat the broiler to high.
2. 2. Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Season the pork chops all over with kosher salt and pepper. Add the olive oil to the skillet, when the oil shimmers, add the pork and sear on both sides for 3-4 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking for about 8-10 minutes, or until the pork chops are cooked through.
3. 3. In a small bowl, whisk together the balsamic vinegar, honey, and oregano. During the last 2 minutes of cooking, pour the balsamic sauce over the pork chops. Remove from the heat and add the peaches. Transfer the skillet to the oven and broil for 4-5 minutes or until the peaches are lightly charred. If the balsamic sauce starts getting too thick, add ¼ cup of water to keep it saucy.
4. 4. Remove from the oven and top with feta, fresh basil, and chili flakes. Serve the pork with the peaches and balsamic sauce from the pan. Enjoy!
