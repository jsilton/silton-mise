## Chef's Note

This dish is a masterclass in **Flavor Balancing**: the sweetness of the peaches, the funk of the feta, and the sharp acid of the balsamic glaze work together to elevate the humble pork chop. The secret is the **Broiler Char**: we sear the pork in a skillet first, then finish it under the broiler with the peach slices to caramelize the fruit sugars and melt the cheese simultaneously.

## Directions

1.  **Sear:** Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Season pork with salt and pepper. Sear for 3-4 minutes per side until golden.
2.  **The Glaze:** Reduce heat to medium. Pour in the balsamic vinegar, honey, and thyme. Simmer for 3 minutes until the liquid is thick and syrupy.
3.  **Peaches:** Place peach slices on top of and around the pork chops.
4.  **Broil:** Transfer the skillet to the oven (under the broiler). Broil for 4-5 minutes until the peaches are charred at the edges and the pork hits 145°F.
5.  **Finish:** Remove from oven. Sprinkle with feta, fresh basil, and chili flakes. Let rest for 5 minutes.
