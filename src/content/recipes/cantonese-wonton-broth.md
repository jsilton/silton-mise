## Chef's Note

Authentic Cantonese wonton broth from Hong Kong should have a subtle seafood note to complement the shrimp in the wontons. Dried shrimp steeped with ginger creates this delicate oceanic flavor. The broth should be crystal clear and golden, not cloudy. Always boil wontons in a separate pot of plain water so the starch doesn't cloud your carefully made broth.

## Directions

1.  **Infuse:** In a large pot, combine the chicken broth, smashed ginger, green onion pieces, and dried shrimp.
2.  **Simmer:** Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.
3.  **Strain:** Pour the broth through a fine-mesh strainer to remove the solids. The liquid should be perfectly clear.
4.  **Season:** Stir in the light soy sauce and fish sauce. Add salt and a pinch of white pepper to taste.
5.  **Serve:** Keep hot while you boil the wontons in a **separate** pot of plain water. This ensures your broth stays clear and doesn't get thickened by the starch on the wonton skins.
