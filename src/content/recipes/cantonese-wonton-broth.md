## Chef's Note

A real wonton broth shouldn't just taste like chicken soup. It needs a high "oceanic" note to complement the shrimp in the wonton. In Hong Kong, this comes from dried flounder powder; at home, we achieve this by steeping **Dried Shrimp** and ginger in the stock. The result is a golden, clear, aromatic liquid that elevates the entire meal.

## Directions

1.  **Infuse:** In a large pot, combine the chicken broth, smashed ginger, green onion pieces, and dried shrimp.
2.  **Simmer:** Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.
3.  **Strain:** Pour the broth through a fine-mesh strainer to remove the solids. The liquid should be perfectly clear.
4.  **Season:** Stir in the light soy sauce and fish sauce. Add salt and a pinch of white pepper to taste.
5.  **Serve:** Keep hot while you boil the wontons in a **separate** pot of plain water. This ensures your broth stays clear and doesn't get thickened by the starch on the wonton skins.
