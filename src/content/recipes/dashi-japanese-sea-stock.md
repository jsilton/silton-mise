## Chef's Note
Dashi is the foundation of Japanese cuisine and a masterclass in **Structural Science**. The secret to the Silton Standard is the **Umami Extraction Pattern**: you must remove the kombu just before the water hits a boil. If boiled, the kombu releases bitter, slimy compounds that ruin the clarity of the stock. This "First Dashi" (Ichiban Dashi) provides the clean, ocean-fresh **High Note** essential for professional-grade miso soups and noodle dishes.

## Directions

1.  **Steep:** Place cold water and kombu in a large saucepan. Let sit for 10 minutes to begin the extraction.
2.  **Boil:** Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. **Just before it reaches a boil**, remove and discard the kombu (or save for pickling).
3.  **Bloom:** Sprinkle the katsuo bushi (bonito flakes) over the liquid. Let it come to a full boil, then immediately remove from heat.
4.  **Settle:** Let stand for 3 minutes without stirring until the flakes sink to the bottom.
5.  **Strain:** Pour through a fine-mesh sieve or coffee filter into a clean bowl. Do not squeeze the flakes, as this will cloud the stock.
6.  **Store:** Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 4 days.
