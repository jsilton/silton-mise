## Chef's Note

The lamb burger is a masterclass in flavor balancing. Because lamb is naturally fatty, we use **The Long-Oval Method**: we shape the patties into ovals rather than rounds to maximize the surface area for the **High-Heat Sear**, which renders the external fat into a crispy crust. We maintain **Textural Balance** by using finely diced cucumber in the sauce rather than grated; this provides a Crunch that contrasts the rich meat. The yogurt sauce provides the mandatory **Acid Balance** to cut the gaminess of the lamb.

## Directions

1.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk yogurt, diced cucumber, minced mint, olive oil, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes—this is mandatory for the flavors to meld.
2.  **The Mix:** In a large bowl, combine lamb, onion, garlic, herbs, salt, and pepper. Knead gently until **just incorporated**. Over-mixing will cause the lamb to turn tough.
3.  **Shape:** Form into 4 long oval patties (about 1/2-inch thick). Brush both sides lightly with olive oil.
4.  **Sear:** Preheat a grill or cast-iron skillet to medium-high. Grill for 5-6 minutes per side for medium doneness.
5.  **Toast:** During the last minute, place the pitas on the grill until warm and pliable.
6.  **Assemble:** Place a burger on each pita. Top with a massive dollop of the yogurt sauce, feta, tomatoes, and greens.
7.  **Serve:** Fold and serve immediately while the lamb juices are still hot.
