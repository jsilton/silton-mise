## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate "High Note" meal. The secret to a creamy ricotta sauce without heavy cream is **Emulsion**. We use the starchy pasta water to bind the ricotta and olive oil into a silky glaze that coats the noodles perfectly. The fresh lemon zest provides the brightness, while the Pecorino adds the salty, savory backbone.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in heavily salted water for 1 minute **less** than the package instructions.
2.  **Liquid Gold:** Before draining, **reserve 1 cup of starchy pasta water.**
3.  **The Base:** In a large bowl, whisk together the ricotta, olive oil, Pecorino, lemon juice, zest, and red pepper flakes.
4.  **Bind:** Add 1/4 cup of the hot pasta water to the ricotta mixture and whisk until it looks like a thick cream.
5.  **Toss:** Add the hot pasta to the bowl. Toss vigorously, adding more pasta water a tablespoon at a time until the sauce is glossy and coats every noodle.
6.  **Finish:** Stir in the basil and lots of black pepper. Serve immediately with a final drizzle of oil.
