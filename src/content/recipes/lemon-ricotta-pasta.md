## Chef's Note

This is a simple spring pasta from the Roman/Lazio tradition, similar to cacio e pepe but made with ricotta instead of pecorino alone. Fresh sheep's milk ricotta is traditional in Rome, where it's been made for centuries. The secret is using starchy pasta water to emulsify the ricotta and olive oil into a creamy sauce that coats the noodles - the pasta water acts as a binding agent. Lemon zest (not just juice) is critical for brightness without adding too much liquid that would thin the sauce. Pecorino Romano adds the salty, sheep's milk tang that's essential to Roman pasta dishes.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in heavily salted water for 1 minute **less** than the package instructions.
2.  **Liquid Gold:** Before draining, **reserve 1 cup of starchy pasta water.**
3.  **The Base:** In a large bowl, whisk together the ricotta, olive oil, Pecorino, lemon juice, zest, and red pepper flakes.
4.  **Bind:** Add 1/4 cup of the hot pasta water to the ricotta mixture and whisk until it looks like a thick cream.
5.  **Toss:** Add the hot pasta to the bowl. Toss vigorously, adding more pasta water a tablespoon at a time until the sauce is glossy and coats every noodle.
6.  **Finish:** Stir in the basil and lots of black pepper. Serve immediately with a final drizzle of oil.
