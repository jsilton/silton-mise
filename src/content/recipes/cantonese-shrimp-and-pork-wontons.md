## Chef's Note

Cantonese wontons from Guangdong province have been made for centuries, traditionally served in clear broth. The key to the bouncy texture is stirring the meat mixture vigorously in one direction until it becomes sticky and emulsified—this develops the protein structure. Using a mix of finely chopped and chunky shrimp gives you both flavor and textural contrast. Water chestnuts add crunch; if you don't like them, finely minced celery or Fuji apple work as substitutes.

## Directions

1.  **The Paste:** In a large bowl, combine the pork, the **finely chopped** half of the shrimp, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, sesame oil, sugar, white pepper, salt, and egg.
2.  **The Texture:** Stir the mixture **vigorously in one direction** for 3-5 minutes until it becomes pale, sticky, and forms a cohesive paste. Do not skip this!
3.  **Add Texture:** Fold in the water chestnuts (or celery), green onions, and the remaining **shrimp chunks**.
4.  **The Test:** Fry a small "tab" of the filling in a skillet. Taste for seasoning and adjust salt if needed.
5.  **Assemble:** Place 1 tsp of filling in a wrapper. Moisten edges, fold into a triangle, and bring the two side corners together to form a "nurse's cap." Press out all air.
