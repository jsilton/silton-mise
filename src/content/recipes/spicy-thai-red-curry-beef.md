## Chef's Note

In Thai cooking, curry paste is traditionally "bloomed" or fried in coconut cream to release its aromatics. Spooning the thick cream layer from the top of the can and frying curry paste in it until fragrant develops flavor quickly, mimicking the depth of slow-simmered curries. Adding paper-thin beef slices at the very end and cooking just 2-3 minutes keeps them tender rather than tough.

## Directions

1.  **The Bloom:** Spoon the thick coconut cream from the top of the can into a large skillet. Add the curry paste. Fry over medium-high for 2 minutes until fragrant and bubbly.
2.  **Simmer:** Add the remaining coconut milk, brown sugar, fish sauce, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil.
3.  **Stage 2:** Add the bell peppers and onion. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 4 minutes until tender-crisp.
4.  **The Crunch:** Add the thin beef slices. Cook for only 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until just browned.
5.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Stir in the fresh basil and lime juice for the mandatory **Acid Balance**.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately over [Basmati Rice](/mise/recipes/basmati-rice) with lime wedges.
