## Chef's Note

This is the baseline for 20-minute quick main dishes. The secret to its Success is **The Coconut Cream Bloom Method**: you must spoon the thick layer of cream from the top of the can into the skillet first and fry the curry paste in it until the oil separates. This "blooms" the aromatics and creates a professional depth usually only found in slow-simmered curries. We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The 3-Minute Sear**: we flash-fry the thin beef slices at the very end to ensure a succulent Texture rather than a chewy texture.

## Directions

1.  **The Bloom:** Spoon the thick coconut cream from the top of the can into a large skillet. Add the curry paste. Fry over medium-high for 2 minutes until fragrant and bubbly.
2.  **Simmer:** Add the remaining coconut milk, brown sugar, fish sauce, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil.
3.  **Stage 2:** Add the bell peppers and onion. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 4 minutes until tender-crisp.
4.  **The Crunch:** Add the thin beef slices. Cook for only 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until just browned.
5.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Stir in the fresh basil and lime juice for the mandatory **Acid Balance**.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately over [Basmati Rice](/silton-mise/recipes/basmati-rice) with lime wedges.
