## Chef's Note

Tossing firm peaches in the Fresno chile-lemon dressing for 15 minutes before adding avocado allows acid to soften the peaches slightly while infusing them with chili heat—a technique called maceration. Adding creamy avocado and crunchy pistachios only at serving time ensures a spectrum of textures in every bite, preventing the avocado from oxidizing and the nuts from becoming soggy.

## Directions

1.  **The Dressing:** In a large bowl, whisk together lemon juice, oil, honey, shallot, and the Fresno chile slices. Season with salt and pepper.
2.  **Macerate:** Add the peach wedges to the dressing. Toss vigorously and **let stand for 15 minutes** at room temperature.
3.  **Combine:** Gently fold in the avocado wedges and the fresh mint. Use your hands to ensure the avocado is coated without smashing it.
4.  **The Crunch:** Transfer to a large platter. Sprinkle the roasted pistachios over the top.
5.  **Finish:** Season with one final crack of black pepper and a drizzle of high-quality oil.
