## Chef's Note

This salad is a study in **Texture Integrity** through **The Maceration Pattern**. The secret to its Success is tossing the firm peaches in the Fresno-lemon emulsion for 15 minutes _before_ adding the avocado. This allows the acid to soften the peaches slightly while infusing them with chili heat. We maintain the "Bounce" by adding the avocado and pistachios only at the moment of serving—this ensures you have a spectrum of creamy, crunchy, and "Snappy" textures in every bite.

## Directions

1.  **The Dressing:** In a large bowl, whisk together lemon juice, oil, honey, shallot, and the Fresno chile slices. Season with salt and pepper.
2.  **Macerate:** Add the peach wedges to the dressing. Toss vigorously and **let stand for 15 minutes** at room temperature.
3.  **Combine:** Gently fold in the avocado wedges and the fresh mint. Use your hands to ensure the avocado is coated without smashing it.
4.  **The Snap:** Transfer to a large platter. Sprinkle the roasted pistachios over the top.
5.  **Finish:** Season with one final crack of black pepper and a drizzle of high-quality oil.
