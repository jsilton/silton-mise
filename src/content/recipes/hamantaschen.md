## Chef's Note

Hamantaschen are the ultimate test of **Structural Science** in Jewish baking. The secret to a cookie that doesn't "blow out" in the oven is **The Pinwheel Fold Pattern**: when folding the three sides, you must tuck one corner under the next flap to create a self-locking triangle. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The Overnight Chill**: the dough must be stone-cold before rolling. This prevents the butter from melting too quickly, ensuring a "Snap" that is delicate and shortbread-like rather than bready. Always use exactly 1 tsp of filling—overfilling is the Gold Standard error that leads to leakage.

## Directions

1.  **The Emulsion:** In a stand mixer, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy (3 mins). Add the egg, vanilla, and orange zest; beat until perfectly combined.
2.  **The Mix:** Sift in the flour and salt. Mix on low speed until a crumbly dough forms. **Stop immediately.**
3.  **The Knead:** Use your hands to gently knead the crumbles into a smooth, tacky ball. If too dry, add cold water 1 tsp at a time.
4.  **The Chill:** Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for **at least 3 hours** (overnight is best).
5.  **Roll:** On a floured surface, roll dough to a uniform 1/8-inch thickness (The Crisp Standard).
6.  **Cut:** Use a 3-inch round cutter to cut circles. Re-roll scraps once.
7.  **Fill & Fold:** Place 1 tsp filling in the center. Fold the three sides up to form a triangle. **The Pinwheel:** Tuck the left corner of each flap _under_ the adjacent side to lock it. Pinch the corners firmly.
8.  **Bake:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the edges are just barely golden.
9.  **Store:** Let cool completely. Store in an airtight container to maintain the "Snap."
