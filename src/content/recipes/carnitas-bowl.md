## Chef's Note

True carnitas from Michoacán are braised low and slow, then crisped to create edges that shatter against tender, pull-apart meat. This technique packs pork tightly in a dish so it braises in its own rendered fat—no vat of lard required. The double-broil finish is non-negotiable: broil, stir, broil again. For a faster weeknight version using ground pork, see [[chipotle-pork-and-sweet-corn-tamale-bowls]].

## Directions

1.  **Season:** Salt the pork chunks generously. Let sit 30 minutes (or overnight in fridge).
2.  **Arrange:** Preheat oven to 275°F. Pack pork tightly in a 9x13 baking dish. Squeeze orange quarters over meat and nestle them in. Add onion, garlic, bay leaves, and cinnamon. Drizzle oil over top.
3.  **Braise:** Cover tightly with foil. Bake 3-3.5 hours until fork-tender.
4.  **Strain:** Remove aromatics and discard. Drain pork, reserving liquid. Skim fat from liquid and add it back to the meat.
5.  **Shred:** Pull pork into large chunks with two forks. Season with salt.
6.  **Crisp:** Spread on a sheet pan. Broil 6 minutes until edges crisp. Stir. Broil 6 more minutes.
7.  **Elote Sauce:** Mix mayo, sour cream, half the cotija, and chile powder.
8.  **Assemble:** Rice in bowls. Top with carnitas, black beans, charred corn dressed with elote sauce, pickled onions, cabbage, avocado, pepitas, remaining cotija, cilantro, and lime.
