## Chef's Note

The secret to a "Kitchen Standard" orzo soup is **Culinary Technique** through **The Starch Roux Method**. We sauté the vegetables and then stir in a small amount of flour _before_ the broth; this creates a light body that holds the ingredients in suspension without being heavy. We maintain **Textural Balance** by simmering the orzo directly in the broth only until al dente—overcooking will turn the soup into a thick porridge. The fresh lemon juice is the mandatory **High Note** that bridges the earthy herbs and savory chicken.

## Directions

1.  **Aromatics:** In a large soup pot, heat butter and oil over medium-high. Sauté onion, carrots, and celery for 5-7 minutes until soft.
2.  **The Roux:** Add garlic and sauté for 30 seconds. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir for 1 minute to cook out the raw flour taste.
3.  **The Simmer:** Slowly pour in the chicken broth, whisking to dissolve the flour. Add Italian seasoning and the diced chicken. Bring to a boil.
4.  **The Orzo:** Reduce heat to medium-low. Add the dry orzo. Simmer for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally (orzo loves to stick to the bottom), until the pasta is al dente and the chicken is cooked through (165°F).
5.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Stir in the fresh parsley and lemon juice.
6.  **Serve:** Season generously with salt and pepper. Serve immediately. Note: orzo will continue to absorb liquid as it sits; add a splash of broth when reheating.
