## Directions

1. Combine stock, soy sauce, rice wine or sherry, sugar and salt to taste in a small bowl. Stir until sugar and salt dissolve. Combine garlic, ginger, and pepper flakes or minced chile in another bowl.
2. Bring a large saucepan or pot of water to a boil, add salt to taste and baby broccoli. As soon as water comes back to a boil (about 1 minute), use a skimmer to remove broccoli and transfer it to a bowl of cold water. Drain in a colander, then on paper towels. Cut stems away from florets and slice about 1/2 inch thick. Bring water back to a boil and cook soba. Drain and toss with 2 teaspoons sesame oil.
3. Place all ingredients within reach of your wok. Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok over high heat until a drop of water evaporates within a second or two when added. Swirl in 1 tablespoon of the oil and add tofu. Stir-fry 1 to 2 minutes, until it begins to color, and remove to a plate. Add remaining oil and garlic, ginger and chile. Stir-fry for no more than 10 seconds and add mushrooms. Stir-fry for 1 minute and add broccoli and the light parts of the scallions. Stir-fry 1 to 2 minutes. Add the noodles, tofu and the stock mixture. Reduce heat to medium and stir-fry 1 to 2 minutes. Add cilantro and the dark green part of the scallions, stir-fry another 30 seconds to a minute, until well combined, and serve.
