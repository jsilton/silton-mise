## Chef's Note

The secret to perfect Soba is **Textural Balance** through **The Buckwheat Shock Method**. Soba noodles are more delicate than wheat pasta; you must rinse them under cold running water for 1 minute immediately after boiling to remove the surface starch and ensure a clean, crispy bite. We use **The Wok Sear**: flash-frying the tofu and shiitakes on the highest possible heat ensures they develop a charred exterior that provides a smoky Crunch against the earthy, nutty Texture of the noodles.

## Directions

1.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk stock, soy sauce, wine, ginger, and garlic.
2.  **Blanch:** Boil baby broccoli for 1 minute. Shock in ice water. Drain and pat **bone-dry**.
3.  **Boil Soba:** Cook soba noodles for 4-5 minutes until al dente. Drain and rinse under cold water for 1 minute. Toss with 1 tsp sesame oil.
4.  **The Sear:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok until smoking. Sear tofu for 2 minutes until golden. Remove.
5.  **The Crunch:** Add 1 tbsp oil. Sauté shiitakes and scallions for 2 minutes. Add the blanched broccoli.
6.  **Bind:** Add the noodles, tofu, and the stock mixture. Toss vigorously over high heat for 2 minutes until the liquid has emulsified into a glossy glaze.
7.  **Serve:** Stir in the cilantro and sesame oil. Serve immediately.
