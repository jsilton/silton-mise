## Chef's Note
The secret to this "Heritage" peach ice cream is the **Skin-on Standard**. We chop the peaches with the skins on; during the maceration process, the pigments from the skin bleed into the sugar, providing a natural rosy color and a deeper, more complex peach aroma. We use **The Double-Boiler Pattern**: cooking the custard gently over simmering water ensures a stable "Bounce" that never turns into scrambled eggs. The lemon juice provides the mandatory **Acid Finish** to cut the heavy cream.

## Directions

1.  **Macerate:** Toss chopped peaches with 1/2 cup sugar and lemon juice. **Refrigerate for at least 2 hours** to draw out the syrup.
2.  **Custard:** Place milk in a double boiler over medium heat. Bring just to a simmer.
3.  **Emulsify:** In a bowl, whisk eggs, yolks, and 3/4 cup sugar. Slowly whisk 1/2 cup of the hot milk into the eggs to temper. 
4.  **Thicken:** Return the mixture to the double boiler. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for 15 minutes until the custard is thick enough to coat the spoon.
5.  **Chill:** Whisk in the heavy cream. Refrigerate until stone-cold (at least 4 hours).
6.  **Churn:** Drain the peaches. Stir the accumulated peach syrup into the custard base. Pour into your ice cream maker.
7.  **Finish:** Add the chopped peaches during the final minute of churning to maintain **Texture Integrity**. 
8.  **Set:** Freeze for 2 hours before serving.
