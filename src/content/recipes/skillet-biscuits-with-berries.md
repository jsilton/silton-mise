## Chef's Note

This is a fast, impressive dessert that combines the best of cobblers and biscuits. We cook the berries in an ovenproof skillet until they form a thick, jammy syrup, then drop cold-butter biscuits directly onto the fruit. As it bakes, the bottom of the biscuits steam in the berry juice while the tops develop a shatteringly crisp crust under the broiler. The orange zest provides the bright acidity needed to balance the sweet berries.

## Directions

1.  **The Dough:** In a bowl, cut cold butter into flour, sugar, and baking powder until pea-sized. Stir in half-and-half until a shaggy dough forms. Scoop into 8 loose balls.
2.  **The Reduction:** In a large ovenproof skillet, combine 3/4 cup sugar, berries, orange zest, cinnamon, and 1 cup water. Boil vigorously for 10 minutes until berries are broken down.
3.  **Assemble:** Arrange the dough mounds on top of the bubbling fruit.
4.  **Cook:** Cover the skillet. Simmer over **very low** heat for 15 minutes until the biscuits are springy and cooked through.
5.  **The Crunch:** Remove lid. Sprinkle biscuits with sugar. Place the entire skillet under the **broiler** for 5 minutes until the tops are charred and crispy.
6.  **Serve:** Serve warm from the skillet with a massive dollop of whipped cream for the final **High Note**.
