## Chef's Note

These are classic mashed potatoes. To ensure the best texture, after draining the potatoes, return them to the hot pot for 2 minutes to cook off every drop of surface water. This ensures the starch is ready to absorb the butter, cream, and cream cheese. We use an electric mixer for exactly 60 seconds to create a texture that is light and aerated rather than heavy and leaden.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Place potatoes in a large pot. Cover with cold salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 16-20 minutes until fork-tender.
2.  **The Dry Method:** Drain the potatoes thoroughly. Return them to the hot pot over low heat for 2 minutes, shaking the pot constantly, until the potatoes look "chalky" and dry.
3.  **The Emulsion:** Mound the potatoes to one side. Add the butter, cream cheese, and warmed half-and-half to the empty side. Let the butter melt into the liquid.
4.  **Beat:** Remove from heat. Using a handheld electric mixer, beat on medium speed for 30-60 seconds. **Stop immediately** once the mixture is smooth and billowy.
5.  **Serve:** Stir in the salt and plenty of black pepper. Serve immediately with a "High Note" pat of butter.
