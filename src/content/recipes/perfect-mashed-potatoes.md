## Chef's Note

These are the definitive "Gold Standard" mashed potatoes. To ensure **Texture Integrity**, we use the **Dry-Steam Pattern**: after draining the potatoes, you must return them to the hot pot for 2 minutes to cook off every drop of surface water. This ensures the starch is "thirsty" and ready to absorb **The Triple Cream Emulsion** (Butter, Cream, and Cream Cheese). We use an **Electric Mixer** for exactly 60 seconds to create a "Bounce" that is light and aerated rather than heavy and leaden.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Place potatoes in a large pot. Cover with cold salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 16-20 minutes until fork-tender.
2.  **The Dry Pattern:** Drain the potatoes thoroughly. Return them to the hot pot over low heat for 2 minutes, shaking the pot constantly, until the potatoes look "chalky" and dry.
3.  **The Emulsion:** Mound the potatoes to one side. Add the butter, cream cheese, and warmed half-and-half to the empty side. Let the butter melt into the liquid.
4.  **Beat:** Remove from heat. Using a handheld electric mixer, beat on medium speed for 30-60 seconds. **Stop immediately** once the mixture is smooth and billowy.
5.  **Serve:** Stir in the salt and plenty of black pepper. Serve immediately with a "High Note" pat of butter.
