## Chef's Note
Risotto is the ultimate test of **Structural Science**. The secret to a "Restaurant Quality" texture is **The Starch-Bind Emulsion Pattern**: we add the hot broth one ladle at a time, stirring constantly to "bruise" the rice grains; this releases amylopectin starch, which creates a natural, velvety creaminess without needing massive amounts of fat. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The Shrimp Snap Pattern**: we sear the shrimp first and remove them *before* starting the rice, adding them back only in the final minute. This ensures the shrimp stay "Snappy" rather than overcooking into rubbery curls. The lemon juice provides the mandatory **Acid Finish**.

## Directions

1.  **The Snap:** In a large wide skillet, melt butter over medium-high. Add shrimp in a single layer. Sear for 2 minutes per side until just opaque. Remove to a plate.
2.  **Foundation:** In the same pan, add onions and garlic. Sauté for 3 minutes until translucent. 
3.  **Toast:** Add the Arborio rice. Stir for 2 minutes until the edges of the grains look translucent (The Toast Pattern). 
4.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the wine. Stir until completely absorbed.
5.  **The Bind:** Add the hot broth one ladle at a time. Stir constantly. Wait until each ladle is fully absorbed before adding the next. This will take 18-22 minutes.
6.  **The Bounce:** Once the rice is al dente, stir in the heavy cream, Parmesan, lemon juice, and zest. 
7.  **Combine:** Fold the seared shrimp and fresh basil into the risotto. Toss for 1 minute until the shrimp are warmed through.
8.  **Serve:** Garnish with extra basil and a "High Note" crack of black pepper.
