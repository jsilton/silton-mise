## Chef's Note

Risotto is the ultimate test of **Culinary Technique**. The secret to a restaurant-quality texture is **The Starch-Bind Emulsion Method**: we add the hot broth one ladle at a time, stirring constantly to "bruise" the rice grains; this releases amylopectin starch, which creates a natural, velvety creaminess without needing massive amounts of fat. We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Shrimp Snap Method**: we sear the shrimp first and remove them _before_ starting the rice, adding them back only in the final minute. This ensures the shrimp stay crispy rather than overcooking into rubbery curls. The lemon juice provides the mandatory **Acid Balance**.

## Directions

1.  **The Crunch:** In a large wide skillet, melt butter over medium-high. Add shrimp in a single layer. Sear for 2 minutes per side until just opaque. Remove to a plate.
2.  **Foundation:** In the same pan, add onions and garlic. Sauté for 3 minutes until translucent.
3.  **Toast:** Add the Arborio rice. Stir for 2 minutes until the edges of the grains look translucent (The Toast Method).
4.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the wine. Stir until completely absorbed.
5.  **The Bind:** Add the hot broth one ladle at a time. Stir constantly. Wait until each ladle is fully absorbed before adding the next. This will take 18-22 minutes.
6.  **The Texture:** Once the rice is al dente, stir in the heavy cream, Parmesan, lemon juice, and zest.
7.  **Combine:** Fold the seared shrimp and fresh basil into the risotto. Toss for 1 minute until the shrimp are warmed through.
8.  **Serve:** Garnish with extra basil and a "High Note" crack of black pepper.
