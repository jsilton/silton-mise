## Chef's Note

Risotto originated in Northern Italy (Milan and the Veneto) where short-grain rice has been grown since the 15th century. The technique requires patience - adding hot broth one ladle at a time and stirring constantly releases the rice's starch (amylopectin), which creates the signature creamy texture without needing excessive butter or cream. This is called "mantecatura" in Italian. Arborio is the most common variety, though Carnaroli is preferred by Italian chefs for its firmer texture. Sear the shrimp first and add them back at the end so they don't overcook and become rubbery. The lemon cuts through the richness.

## Directions

1.  **The Crunch:** In a large wide skillet, melt butter over medium-high. Add shrimp in a single layer. Sear for 2 minutes per side until just opaque. Remove to a plate.
2.  **Foundation:** In the same pan, add onions and garlic. Sauté for 3 minutes until translucent.
3.  **Toast:** Add the Arborio rice. Stir for 2 minutes until the edges of the grains look translucent (The Toast Method).
4.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the wine. Stir until completely absorbed.
5.  **The Bind:** Add the hot broth one ladle at a time. Stir constantly. Wait until each ladle is fully absorbed before adding the next. This will take 18-22 minutes.
6.  **The Texture:** Once the rice is al dente, stir in the heavy cream, Parmesan, lemon juice, and zest.
7.  **Combine:** Fold the seared shrimp and fresh basil into the risotto. Toss for 1 minute until the shrimp are warmed through.
8.  **Serve:** Garnish with extra basil and a "High Note" crack of black pepper.
