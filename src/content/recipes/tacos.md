## Chef's Note

This Tex-Mex weeknight taco bar keeps lean ground turkey flavorful by simmering it with Better Than Bouillon chicken base, which adds umami depth that mimics slow-cooked meat. Korean pickled cucumbers provide a surprising tangy crunch that elevates the meal beyond standard taco seasoning.

## Directions

1.  **Meat:** Brown the meat in a large skillet. Add the 1/2 cup water, taco seasoning, and the 1 tsp of Better Than Bouillon. Simmer for 5 minutes until the liquid is reduced and the meat is saucy.
2.  **Shells:** Warm the hard shells in a 350°F oven for 5 minutes to crisp them. Warm tortillas in a dry pan.
3.  **Assemble:** Set everything out in bowls and let everyone build their own.
