## Chef's Note

The secret to a great weeknight taco bar is **Contrast and Depth**. Ground turkey can be bland; we fix this by simmering it with **Better Than Bouillon**, which provides an umami punch that mimics slow-cooked meat. Adding **Korean Pickled Cucumbers** provides a surprising and vital "acid-crunch" that elevates this from a basic box meal to something restaurant-worthy.

## Directions

1.  **Meat:** Brown the meat in a large skillet. Add the 1/2 cup water, taco seasoning, and the 1 tsp of Better Than Bouillon. Simmer for 5 minutes until the liquid is reduced and the meat is saucy.
2.  **Shells:** Warm the hard shells in a 350°F oven for 5 minutes to crisp them. Warm tortillas in a dry pan.
3.  **Assemble:** Set everything out in bowls and let everyone build their own.
