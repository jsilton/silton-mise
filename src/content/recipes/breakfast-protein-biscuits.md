## Directions

1. Preheat the oven 400F and line a baking tray with parchment paper.
2. In a medium mixing bowl whisk together greek yogurt and eggs. In a separate medium mixing bowl, combine flour, ground flax seed, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, baking powder and salt.
3. Slowly add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, mixing well.
4. Add spinach, chives, 1 cup of the shredded cheese and the ham. Mix until the ingredients are fully combined (you may need to use your hands to ensure everything is fully incorporated.
5. Lightly flour your hands and divide the dough into 12 even-sized 1-inch round disk shaped biscuits(about ⅓ cup of batter in each). Arrange the biscuits on the prepared baking tray (please note depending on the size of your tray you may need to use 2 trays to ensure the biscuits are evenly spaced). Sprinkle the tops with the remaining cheese.
6. Bake at 400F for 5 minutes, decrease the temperature to 350F and bake for an additional 20 minutes (do not open the oven in between). Once the bottom of the biscuits are golden brown and the tops are just beginning to brown, your biscuits are done!
