## Chef's Note

These biscuits are a masterclass in **Culinary Technique**. By using **Greek Yogurt** as the primary hydrator instead of heavy cream or butter, we achieve a high-protein nutritious profile while maintaining a tender, moist crumb. The secret is the **Folding Technique**: we fold the spinach and ham in at the very end to ensure **Textural Balance**—you want distinct pops of salt and green in every bite, not a uniform gray mass.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
2.  **Wet & Dry:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the yogurt and eggs. In a separate large bowl, whisk the flour, flaxseed, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, baking powder, and salt.
3.  **Combine:** Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet. Stir until a thick, sticky dough forms.
4.  **Fold:** Fold in the chopped spinach, chives, ham, and 1 cup of the cheese. Use your hands if necessary to ensure even distribution without overworking the dough.
5.  **Shape:** Lightly flour your hands. Scoop about 1/3 cup of dough for each biscuit. Form into 1-inch thick disks and arrange on the baking sheet.
6.  **The Temperature Method:** Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese on top. Bake at 400°F for 5 minutes (to kickstart the rise), then **lower the heat to 350°F** for the remaining 20 minutes.
7.  **Finish:** They are done when the bottoms are golden brown and the cheese on top is bubbly and crisp.
