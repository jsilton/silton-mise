## Chef's Note

This is the baseline for high-performance **Fuel** breakfasts. We use **Modern Heritage** techniques to replace heavy butter with **Extra-Virgin Olive Oil**; the oil's grassy notes amplify the sweetness of the bananas while ensuring a moist, open crumb. The secret to the Silton Standard is **The Blender Pattern**: we blend the wet ingredients until perfectly emulsified before folding in the flour—this prevents over-mixing the gluten and guarantees a tender "Bounce" in every slice.

## Directions

1.  **The Emulsion:** Preheat oven to 325°F. Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. In a large bowl (or blender), whisk the olive oil and honey until combined. Add the eggs, mashed bananas, and milk; whisk vigorously until smooth.
2.  **The Bloom:** Add the baking soda, vanilla, salt, and cinnamon. Whisk for 30 seconds to allow the spices to integrate into the fat.
3.  **Incorporate:** Using a large spoon, fold in the flour until **just combined**. A few tiny lumps are the mandatory guard against toughness. Fold in chocolate chips if using.
4.  **The Swirl:** Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle a pinch of cinnamon on top and run a knife in a zig-zag pattern for a visual "High Note."
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 55-60 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
6.  **Rest:** Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. Slice only once completely cool to preserve the structural integrity.
