## Chef's Note

Real Alfredo is an emulsion of fat and starch. It does not require flour or thickeners found in jars. The secret is the **Pasta Water**: the starchy water from your boiling pasta helps the butter and cheese bind into a silky, velvety sauce that won't separate. Always grate your own Parmesan; pre-shredded cheese is coated in starch that will make your sauce grainy.

## Directions

1.  **Melt:** In a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.
2.  **Simmer:** Pour in the heavy cream and add the garlic. Let it simmer gently for 2 minutes until slightly thickened.
3.  **Emulsify:** Turn the heat to **LOW**. Gradually whisk in the Parmesan cheese until melted and smooth.
4.  **Bind:** Add the reserved pasta water and whisk vigorously. This is the "glue" that holds it all together.
5.  **Season:** Stir in salt, pepper, and a tiny pinch of nutmeg if using.
6.  **Toss:** Add your hot, cooked pasta directly to the skillet and toss until every strand is coated.
