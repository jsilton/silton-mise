## Chef's Note

Fettuccine Alfredo was created in 1908 by Alfredo di Lelio in Rome for his pregnant wife who had lost her appetite. The original contained only butter, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and pasta - no cream. American restaurants added heavy cream in the 1960s to make it richer and prevent it from drying out under heat lamps. This Americanized version is what most of us know and love. The key is using freshly grated real Parmigiano-Reggiano - pre-shredded cheese contains anti-caking agents that make the sauce grainy. Starchy pasta water is the secret ingredient that helps everything emulsify into a silky sauce.

## Directions

1.  **Melt:** In a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.
2.  **Simmer:** Pour in the heavy cream and add the garlic. Let it simmer gently for 2 minutes until slightly thickened.
3.  **Emulsify:** Turn the heat to **LOW**. Gradually whisk in the Parmesan cheese until melted and smooth.
4.  **Bind:** Add the reserved pasta water and whisk vigorously. This is the "glue" that holds it all together.
5.  **Season:** Stir in salt, pepper, and a tiny pinch of nutmeg if using.
6.  **Toss:** Add your hot, cooked pasta directly to the skillet and toss until every strand is coated.
