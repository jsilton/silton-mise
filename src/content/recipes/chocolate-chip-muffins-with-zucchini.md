## Chef's Note

This is a nutritious breakfast muffin. By using buckwheat flour, we get a nutty flavor that stands up to the richness of the chocolate. The secret to good texture is squeezing the shredded zucchini in a towel until it is bone-dry before adding it to the batter. This ensures the muffins stay tender and moist rather than turning into mushy pucks.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or use paper liners.
2.  **Dry Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk together the buckwheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
3.  **Wet Mix:** In a separate bowl, whisk the milk, egg, maple syrup, oil, and vanilla until smooth and emulsified.
4.  **Combine:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Stir with a spatula until **just combined** (a few lumps are mandatory).
5.  **Fold:** Fold in the chocolate chips and the **squeezed zucchini**.
6.  **Bake:** Scoop the batter into the muffin cups (about 3/4 full). Bake for 16-18 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
7.  **Cool:** Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes to allow the buckwheat structure to set before removing to a rack.
