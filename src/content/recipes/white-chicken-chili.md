## Chef's Note

This Tex-Mex white chili features nixtamalized hominy, which provides a distinctive chewy texture that contrasts soft white beans and shredded chicken. Adding sour cream at the very end of the slow-cooking process keeps the sauce thick and velvety without breaking. Green chilies add mild heat and acidity.

## Directions

1.  **Foundation:** Place chicken breasts at the bottom of a 4-quart slow cooker.
2.  **Layer:** Add the drained beans and hominy.
3.  **The Bind:** In a medium bowl, whisk together broth, condensed soup, green chilies, and taco seasoning. Pour over the chicken.
4.  **Slow Cook:** Cover and cook on **Low for 8-10 hours**.
5.  **The Pull:** Using two forks, shred the chicken directly in the pot. Stir to incorporate the juices.
6.  **Finish:** Stir in the sour cream until the sauce is creamy and pale.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with green onions and a massive amount of shredded Monterey Jack for the final savory **High Note**.
