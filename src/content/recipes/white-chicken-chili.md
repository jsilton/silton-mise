## Chef's Note

The secret to a "Gold Standard" white chili is **Texture Integrity** through **The Hominy Pattern**. By using hominy instead of just corn, we introduce a chewy, nixtamalized "Snap" that contrasts the soft white beans and shredded chicken. We maintain **Structural Science** through **The Late-Cream Bind**: adding the sour cream only at the very end of the 8-hour slow-cook ensures the sauce remains thick and velvety (The "Bounce") without breaking. The green chilies provide the mandatory **Acid Finish**.

## Directions

1.  **Foundation:** Place chicken breasts at the bottom of a 4-quart slow cooker.
2.  **Layer:** Add the drained beans and hominy.
3.  **The Bind:** In a medium bowl, whisk together broth, condensed soup, green chilies, and taco seasoning. Pour over the chicken.
4.  **Slow Cook:** Cover and cook on **Low for 8-10 hours**.
5.  **The Pull:** Using two forks, shred the chicken directly in the pot. Stir to incorporate the juices.
6.  **Finish:** Stir in the sour cream until the sauce is creamy and pale.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with green onions and a massive amount of shredded Monterey Jack for the final savory **High Note**.
