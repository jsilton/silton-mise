## Chef's Note

This deconstructed tamale bowl captures traditional flavors without the labor of steaming corn husks. Creamy polenta stands in for masa, cooked in chicken broth and finished with frozen corn stirred in at the end so it stays crisp while the base becomes creamy. Chipotle peppers in adobo provide smoky heat, balanced by lime-tossed avocado.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a medium pot, bring chicken broth to a boil. Whisk in polenta and cumin. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes, whisking occasionally.
2.  **Chef Kriger Move:** Once the polenta is thick, stir in the frozen corn, butter, and cheese. Cover and let sit—the residual heat will perfectly cook the corn.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add pork, red onion, and bell pepper. Sear aggressively without moving for 3 minutes to develop a crust. Continue cooking until pork is browned. Drain excess fat.
4.  **The Bloom:** Push meat to the side. Add garlic, oregano, and chipotles. Fry in the center for 45 seconds until fragrant.
5.  **The Sauce:** Pour in the fire-roasted tomatoes. Scrape the fond. Simmer for 5 minutes until the sauce is thick and smoky.
6.  **Assemble:** Scoop the sweet corn polenta into deep bowls. Top with a generous scoop of smoky pork. Crown with the avocado-lime mix, radishes, a dollop of yogurt, and crushed chips for "Snap."
