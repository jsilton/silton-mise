## Chef's Note

This weeknight bowl delivers big Mexican flavors in 35 minutes. Polenta cooked in broth stands in for masa, while chipotle peppers in adobo provide smoky depth. The key upgrades: char the corn in a hot skillet before adding, use cotija instead of bland cheese blend, and finish with raw cabbage and pepitas for essential crunch. For a weekend version with braised pork shoulder, see [[carnitas-bowl]].

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** Bring broth to a boil. Whisk in polenta and cumin. Reduce to low and simmer 15 minutes, whisking occasionally, until thick. Stir in butter and cotija. Cover and set aside.
2.  **Char the Corn:** Heat a dry skillet over high heat. Add frozen corn in a single layer. Let sit 2 minutes until charred, then stir. Set aside.
3.  **The Pork:** In the same skillet, add oil over high heat. Add pork and bell pepper. Sear without moving for 3 minutes to develop crust. Break up and cook through.
4.  **The Bloom:** Push meat aside. Add garlic, oregano, and chipotles. Fry 45 seconds until fragrant.
5.  **The Sauce:** Add tomatoes. Scrape fond. Simmer 5 minutes until thick.
6.  **Assemble:** Polenta in bowls, topped with pork, charred corn, avocado, cabbage, pepitas, sour cream, and a lime wedge.
