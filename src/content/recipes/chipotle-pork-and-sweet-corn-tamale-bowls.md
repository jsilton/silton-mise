## Directions

1. The Base (Polenta): Bring 4 cups Chicken Stock to a boil. Whisk in Polenta and 1/2 tsp Cumin. Reduce heat to low. Simmer 15 mins.
2. The Chef Move: When polenta is thickened, stir in the Frozen Corn, Butter, and Cheese. The corn will cook in the residual heat of the mush.
3. The Sear: While polenta bubbles, heat oil in a large skillet on high. Add Pork, Red Onion, and Bell Pepper. Cook aggressively—don't stir too often—until pork is browned and peppers have char marks (approx 8 mins). Drain excess grease if it's pooling.
4. The Bloom: Push meat to the side. Add minced Garlic, Oregano, and Chipotle Peppers. Fry them in the pan center for 45 seconds until aromatic.
5. The Sauce: Pour in Fire Roasted Tomatoes. Scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Simmer for 5 minutes until thickened.
6. Assembly: Ladle Sweet Corn Polenta into bowls. Top with Smoky Pork. Crown with the Avocado Lime mix, Radishes, Yogurt, and Crushed Chips.
