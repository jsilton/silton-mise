## Chef's Note

This dish is a masterclass in **Modularity**. Instead of the labor-intensive process of steaming tamales, we deconstruct the flavors into a high-speed nutritious bowl. The secret to the **Textural Balance** is the **Staged Polenta**: we stir the frozen corn and cheese into the hot polenta at the very end so the corn stays crispy while the base becomes creamy. The **Acid Balance** from the lime-tossed avocado is mandatory to cut through the smoky heat of the chipotle.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a medium pot, bring chicken broth to a boil. Whisk in polenta and cumin. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes, whisking occasionally.
2.  **Chef Kriger Move:** Once the polenta is thick, stir in the frozen corn, butter, and cheese. Cover and let sit—the residual heat will perfectly cook the corn.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add pork, red onion, and bell pepper. Sear aggressively without moving for 3 minutes to develop a crust. Continue cooking until pork is browned. Drain excess fat.
4.  **The Bloom:** Push meat to the side. Add garlic, oregano, and chipotles. Fry in the center for 45 seconds until fragrant.
5.  **The Sauce:** Pour in the fire-roasted tomatoes. Scrape the fond. Simmer for 5 minutes until the sauce is thick and smoky.
6.  **Assemble:** Scoop the sweet corn polenta into deep bowls. Top with a generous scoop of smoky pork. Crown with the avocado-lime mix, radishes, a dollop of yogurt, and crushed chips for "Snap."
