## Chef's Note

This is a masterclass in **Modularity**. The secret to the Silton Standard here is **The Acid-Honey Bind Pattern**: the combination of lime juice (acid) and honey (sugar) creates a marinade that both tenderizes the meat via enzymes and creates a sticky, caramelized "Snap" on the grill. We use **The 2-Hour Minimum**: you must marinate the chicken for at least 2 hours to ensure the smoky chipotle penetrates the protein fibers. Always rest the meat for 5 minutes before slicing to preserve the "Bounce."

## Directions

1.  **The Marinade:** In a large bowl, whisk together the chipotle, honey, lime juice, olive oil, mustard, garlic, and salt.
2.  **The Soak:** Toss the thin chicken breasts in the marinade until heavily coated. **Refrigerate for at least 2 hours** (up to 24 hours).
3.  **The Sear:** Heat a grill or heavy skillet to medium-high. Sear chicken for 4-5 minutes per side until deep golden and charred in spots (Internal temp 165°F).
4.  **Rest:** Transfer to a board and let rest for 5-10 minutes.
5.  **Assemble:** Layer your bowls with [Cilantro Lime Rice](/recipes/cilantro-lime-rice), fresh greens, tomatoes, and avocado.
6.  **Finish:** Slice the chicken into strips and place on top. Serve with extra lime wedges for the mandatory **High Note**.
