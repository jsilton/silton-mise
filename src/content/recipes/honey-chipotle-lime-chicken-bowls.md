## Chef's Note

This Mexican-inspired chicken bowl features a marinade that balances lime juice's acidity with honey's sweetness, tenderizing the meat while creating sticky caramelization on the grill. Marinating for at least 2 hours allows smoky chipotle to penetrate the chicken. Resting the meat for 5 minutes after grilling helps retain its juices.

## Directions

1.  **The Marinade:** In a large bowl, whisk together the chipotle, honey, lime juice, olive oil, mustard, garlic, and salt.
2.  **The Soak:** Toss the thin chicken breasts in the marinade until heavily coated. **Refrigerate for at least 2 hours** (up to 24 hours).
3.  **The Sear:** Heat a grill or heavy skillet to medium-high. Sear chicken for 4-5 minutes per side until deep golden and charred in spots (Internal temp 165°F).
4.  **Rest:** Transfer to a board and let rest for 5-10 minutes.
5.  **Assemble:** Layer your bowls with [Cilantro Lime Rice](/mise/recipes/cilantro-lime-rice), fresh greens, tomatoes, and avocado.
6.  **Finish:** Slice the chicken into strips and place on top. Serve with extra lime wedges for the mandatory **High Note**.
