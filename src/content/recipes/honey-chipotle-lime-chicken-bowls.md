## Directions

1. For the marinade, whisk together the olive oil, lime juice, honey, chipotle peppers and sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, cilantro, salt and pepper.
2. Place the chicken in a shallow dish or ziploc bag and pour the marinade over the top. Make sure the chicken is evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 24 hours (the flavor gets better the longer it marinades).
3. Cook the chicken on a grill, in a skillet or in the oven (broiled) until cooked through, probably 4-5 minutes per side, depending on how it’s cooked. Let rest for 5-10 minutes.
4. Slice the chicken into strips and serve with any or all of the bowl ingredients. Cilantro lime dressing not optional. 🙂
