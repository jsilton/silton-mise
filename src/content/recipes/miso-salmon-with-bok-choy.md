## Directions

1. 1. Start the rice in the rice cooker.
2. 2. Whisk soy sauce, mirin, rice vinegar, honey, lemon juice, miso, salt, pepper, and half of the green onion and garlic together to form the marinade in separate bowl. Remove skin from the salmon fillets and cover completely in marinade. Allow to marinate for at least 10 minutes, preferably for 30.
3. 3. Chop and wash bok choy and set aside with the other half of the green onion and garlic. Setup the salmon on a broiling or cooking rack over a foil-lined pan.
4. 4. Cook the salmon in the oven or toaster oven at 400 degrees without turning for 8-10 minutes, depending on thickness and the distance from broiler. Then, change the setting to broil and cook for 1-2 minutes, so there miso is caramelized on the top.
5. 5. While the salmon is cooking, heat a large skillet or wok over high heat. Cook the green onion and garlic in seasame oil for 1 minute, then saute the bok choy, seasoned with salt and pepper, for 6-8 minutes until almost cooked through. Reduce the heat to low and add the oyster sauce, micing evenly for 1 minute.
6. 6. Serve the salmon over a bed of rice and bok choy. Enjoy!
