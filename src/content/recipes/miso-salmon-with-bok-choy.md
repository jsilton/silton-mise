## Chef's Note

This dish is about the interplay between the buttery, caramelized salmon and the crisp, mineral bite of the bok choy. To get that restaurant-quality "Miso Crust," we use the broiler to bubble and char the sugars in the miso. **The secret to the Bok Choy:** do not boil it! Sauté the garlic and stems first to get a sear, then add the leaves and a splash of water to steam them for 90 seconds. This ensures they stay bright green and crunchy.

## Directions

1.  **The Glaze:** In a small bowl, whisk together the miso, honey, soy sauce, mirin, rice vinegar, and ginger until smooth.
2.  **Prep Salmon:** Pat the salmon fillets bone-dry with paper towels. Arrange on a foil-lined baking sheet.
3.  **Initial Roast:** Brush half of the miso glaze over the salmon. Roast in a 400°F oven for 8 minutes.
4.  **The Char:** Remove salmon, brush with the remaining glaze, and switch the oven to **BROIL**. Place the tray 6 inches from the heat and broil for 2-3 minutes until the glaze is bubbling and has dark charred spots. Pull at an internal temp of 135-140°F.
5.  **The Bok Choy:** While salmon roasts, heat a large skillet or wok over high heat with a splash of oil. Add the garlic and the bok choy (cut-side down). Sear for 2 minutes without moving until the edges are browned.
6.  **Steam:** Pour in 2 tablespoons of water or broth, immediately cover with a lid, and steam for 1 minute.
7.  **Finish:** Remove lid, stir in the oyster sauce and sesame oil. Toss to coat.
8.  **Serve:** Place a mound of [Jasmine Rice](/silton-mise/recipes/homemade-rice-pilaf) in each bowl, top with the salmon and bok choy. Garnish with sesame seeds and green onions.
