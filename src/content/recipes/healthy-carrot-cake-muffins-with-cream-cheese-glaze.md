## Chef's Note

Using the finest holes on your grater for the carrots allows them to melt into the batter, providing moisture without large, distracting chunks. Applesauce reduces oil content while maintaining dense texture. The cream cheese glaze adds welcome tanginess—dip muffin tops while cold for clean coating.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a 12-cup tin. In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.
2.  **Wet Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk the shredded carrots, maple syrup, applesauce, egg, oil, and vanilla until smooth and emulsified.
3.  **Combine:** Slowly stir the flour mixture and milk into the wet ingredients until **just combined**.
4.  **Bake:** Divide batter into liners. Bake for 18-20 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
5.  **Cool:** Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool **completely** before glazing.
6.  **The Glaze:** Whisk softened cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk until smooth.
7.  **Finish:** Dip each cooled muffin top into the glaze. Sprinkle with extra shredded coconut or walnuts for a textural "High Note."
