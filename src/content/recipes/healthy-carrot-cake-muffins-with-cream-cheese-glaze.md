## Chef's Note

These muffins are the "Gold Standard" for breakfast fuel. The secret to a professional-grade carrot muffin is **Texture Integrity** through the **Fine Shred Pattern**: you must use the smallest holes on your grater for the carrots so they "melt" into the batter, providing moisture without large, distracting chunks. We use **Applesauce** to reduce the oil content while maintaining a dense "Bounce." The cream cheese glaze provides the mandatory **Acid Finish**—dip the tops while cold for a clean, professional "Snap."

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a 12-cup tin. In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.
2.  **Wet Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk the shredded carrots, maple syrup, applesauce, egg, oil, and vanilla until smooth and emulsified.
3.  **Combine:** Slowly stir the flour mixture and milk into the wet ingredients until **just combined**.
4.  **Bake:** Divide batter into liners. Bake for 18-20 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
5.  **Cool:** Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool **completely** before glazing.
6.  **The Glaze:** Whisk softened cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk until smooth.
7.  **Finish:** Dip each cooled muffin top into the glaze. Sprinkle with extra shredded coconut or walnuts for a textural "High Note."
