## Directions

1. Add the whiskey, lemon juice, simple syrup, and egg white (if using) to a cocktail shaker without ice.

2. If using egg white, dry shake (shake without ice) vigorously for 10-15 seconds to emulsify.

3. Add ice to the shaker and shake again vigorously for 10-15 seconds until well-chilled.

4. Strain into a chilled rocks glass over fresh ice or serve up in a coupe glass.

5. If you used egg white, garnish with a few drops of Angostura bitters on the foam and drag a toothpick through to create a design.

6. Optionally add a cherry and orange slice. Serve immediately.

## Chef's Note

The Whiskey Sour appeared in the 1860s during the golden age of American bartending, documented in Jerry Thomas's 1862 'Bartender's Guide.' Sours (spirit + citrus + sweetener) were created to make whiskey more palatable and to prevent scurvy on long sea voyages. The egg white addition came later and transforms it from a simple sour into something elegant with a silky texture and beautiful foam cap. The egg white is traditional, safe when shaken properly, and worth including for the luxurious mouthfeel it creates.
