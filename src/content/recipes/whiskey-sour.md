The Whiskey Sour is a classic American cocktail from the 1860s that perfectly balances whiskey, citrus, and sweetness. The addition of egg white creates a silky texture and beautiful foam, elevating this simple drink to something special.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz bourbon or rye whiskey
- 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz egg white (optional but recommended)
- Ice
- Angostura bitters for garnish (optional)
- Maraschino cherry and orange slice (optional)

## Directions

1. Add the whiskey, lemon juice, simple syrup, and egg white (if using) to a cocktail shaker without ice.

2. If using egg white, dry shake (shake without ice) vigorously for 10-15 seconds to emulsify.

3. Add ice to the shaker and shake again vigorously for 10-15 seconds until well-chilled.

4. Strain into a chilled rocks glass over fresh ice or serve up in a coupe glass.

5. If you used egg white, garnish with a few drops of Angostura bitters on the foam and drag a toothpick through to create a design.

6. Optionally add a cherry and orange slice. Serve immediately.

## Chef's Note

The egg white is traditional and creates the signature silky texture and foam cap - it's tasteless and perfectly safe when shaken properly. Always use fresh lemon juice, never bottled. Adjust the sweetness to taste: start with 1/2 oz simple syrup and add more if needed. Bourbon gives a rounder, sweeter drink while rye adds spice and complexity. For a New York Sour, float 1/2 oz red wine on top.
