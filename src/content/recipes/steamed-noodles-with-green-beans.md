## Directions

1. Start by mixing the meat with the marinade ingredients (soy sauce, cornstarch, Shaoxing wine, white pepper). Set aside for 20 minutes while you prepare the rest of the components.
2. Prepare a steamer, making sure no water will touch the noodles during the steaming process. See our post on how to set up a steamer if you’re not familiar with steaming foods in Chinese cooking.
3. Place a large sheet of parchment paper on the steaming rack, and loosely pile the fresh white (wheat) noodles on the parchment paper. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil, tossing the noodles lightly in the oil.
4. Steam for 10 to 12 minutes over high heat (this cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of your noodles). Remove from heat and set aside.
5. Heat another 2 tablespoons oil in a wok over medium heat. Add the ginger and star anise, and cook for 30 seconds.
6. Add the garlic, dried red chilies (if using) and scallions, and stir-fry for one minute.
7. Now add the pork…
8. …and turn up the heat to high. Stir-fry until the pork is opaque.
9. Then spread the pork out in a single layer on the wok’s surface to brown the meat (30 seconds to a minute).
10. Stir in the green beans and cook for a couple minutes.
11. Add the dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, and sugar. Stir everything together and add water. Place the steamed noodles on top of this mixture (do not stir), and cover lid. Cook for 5 minutes.
12. Uncover the wok; you’ll see that the liquid in the wok has reduced slightly. Turn down the heat, and mix everything together to coat the noodles with sauce.
13. The sauce should be soaked into the noodles very quickly. Serve your Bian Dou Men Mian immediately.
14. This dish is very unique and equally delicious!
