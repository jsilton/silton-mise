## Chef's Note

This is a technical "Heritage" dish known as **Bian Dou Men Mian**. The secret to its Success is **The Double-Texture Method**: we steam the fresh noodles separately first to set their structure , then braise them directly on top of the green beans and pork without stirring. This allows the bottom of the noodles to absorb the savory **Dark Soy Glaze** while the top remains light and airy. We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Pork Render**: browning the pork belly in a single layer provides a smoky Crunch that balances the soft beans.

## Directions

1.  **Velvet:** Toss pork with marinade ingredients. Let stand for 20 minutes.
2.  **Steam Noodles:** Line a steamer with parchment. Pile noodles on top, drizzle with 1 tbsp oil, and steam for 10-12 minutes until flexible. Set aside.
3.  **The Sear:** In a wok, sauté ginger, star anise, garlic, and scallions for 1 minute. Add the pork and stir-fry over high heat until opaque and browned.
4.  **The Crunch:** Add the green beans. Sauté for 3 minutes until bright green.
5.  **The Bind:** Stir in both soy sauces, sugar, and water. Bring to a boil.
6.  **The Layer:** Lay the steamed noodles directly on top of the beans. **Do not stir.** Cover tightly with a lid.
7.  **Braise:** Cook for 5-7 minutes over medium-high until the liquid is almost gone.
8.  **Toss:** Uncover and toss the noodles with the beans until every strand is mahogany-brown and glossy. Serve immediately.
