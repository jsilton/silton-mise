## Chef's Note

Blending cottage cheese and oats creates a high-protein batter that mimics traditional flour pancakes. Cook over medium-low heat - the natural sugars in banana and proteins in cheese brown quickly, so lower temperature ensures the center cooks through before the outside burns.

## Directions

1.  **The Batter:** Place oats, banana, cottage cheese, egg, baking powder, cinnamon, and vanilla into a high-powered blender. Blend for 30-45 seconds until completely smooth.
2.  **Prep:** Heat a large non-stick skillet over **medium-low** heat. Lightly coat with oil spray.
3.  **Pour:** Drop the batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto the skillet. If using mix-ins, sprinkle them onto the wet surface of the pancake now.
4.  **Flip:** Cook until bubbles appear on the surface and the edges look set (about 2-3 mins). Flip gently and cook for another 2 minutes until golden brown.
5.  **Finish:** Wipe the skillet clean between batches to prevent the residual sugars from burning.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with a dollop of Greek yogurt or a drizzle of peanut butter.
