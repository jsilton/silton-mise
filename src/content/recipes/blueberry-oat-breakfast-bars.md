## Chef's Note

Firmly pressing the mixture into the pan and then refrigerating for at least one hour after baking prevents crumbling. As the coconut oil and nut butter chill and solidify, they bind the oats into clean, portable bars that hold together beautifully. Overnight chilling works even better.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 340°F (170°C). Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with parchment paper.
2.  **Melt:** In a large saucepan, melt coconut oil, honey, and nut butter over medium heat. Stir until smooth and combined.
3.  **Mix:** Remove from heat. Stir in the oats until every grain is coated. Gently fold in the blueberries.
4.  **Press:** Transfer the mixture to the baking dish. Use the back of a spoon to press down **very firmly**—the more compact it is, the better it will hold.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 15-18 minutes until the edges are just beginning to turn golden brown.
6.  **The Finish:** Allow to cool in the pan at room temperature, then transfer to the fridge for at least 1 hour (mandatory) to firm up.
7.  **Glaze:** Whisk together the yogurt and orange juice. Drizzle over the chilled bars.
8.  **Slice:** Cut into 8 bars and serve cold or at room temperature.
