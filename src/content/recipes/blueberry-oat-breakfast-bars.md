## Chef's Note

The challenge with oat bars is preventing them from crumbling into granola. The secret is **Textural Balance** through the **Cold Set**. By firmly pressing the mixture into the pan and refrigerating it for at least an hour (or overnight) after baking, the coconut oil and nut butter solidify to act as a natural "glue." This allows you to cut clean, portable bars that hold their "Bounce."

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 340°F (170°C). Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with parchment paper.
2.  **Melt:** In a large saucepan, melt coconut oil, honey, and nut butter over medium heat. Stir until smooth and combined.
3.  **Mix:** Remove from heat. Stir in the oats until every grain is coated. Gently fold in the blueberries.
4.  **Press:** Transfer the mixture to the baking dish. Use the back of a spoon to press down **very firmly**—the more compact it is, the better it will hold.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 15-18 minutes until the edges are just beginning to turn golden brown.
6.  **The Finish:** Allow to cool in the pan at room temperature, then transfer to the fridge for at least 1 hour (mandatory) to firm up.
7.  **Glaze:** Whisk together the yogurt and orange juice. Drizzle over the chilled bars.
8.  **Slice:** Cut into 8 bars and serve cold or at room temperature.
