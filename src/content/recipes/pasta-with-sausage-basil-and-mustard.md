## Chef's Note

This is a 30-minute quick meal that relies on **The Mustard Emulsion Method**. The secret to the Kitchen Standard is the **Wine Reduction**: we simmer the hot Italian sausage directly in white wine, scraping up the "fond" to create a deeply savory base. The addition of **Grainy Mustard** provides the mandatory **Acid Balance** that cuts through the rich heavy cream and fatty sausage. We maintain **Textural Balance** by using a tube-shaped pasta (like rigatoni) which acts as a trap for the thick, creamy sauce.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in a large pot of salted water until **very al dente**. Drain.
2.  **The Sear:** In a large skillet, heat oil. Brown the crumbled sausage over medium-high for 5 minutes until crispy.
3.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the white wine. Scrape the bottom of the pan vigorously to release all the browned bits. Simmer for 5 minutes until reduced by half.
4.  **Bind:** Stir in the heavy cream, grainy mustard, and red pepper flakes. Simmer for 2 minutes until the sauce is thick and glossy.
5.  **Toss:** Add the hot pasta and fresh basil to the skillet. Toss for 1 minute until every noodle is coated.
6.  **Serve:** Grate fresh Parmesan over the top and serve immediately.
