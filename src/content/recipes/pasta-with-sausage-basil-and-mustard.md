## Chef's Note

This is a modern Italian-French fusion that combines Italian sausage and fresh basil with French-style Dijon mustard and cream. The grainy Dijon adds a tangy, slightly sharp note that cuts through the rich cream and fatty sausage - it's an unexpected twist that works brilliantly. The technique of deglazing the pan with white wine after browning the sausage captures all those flavorful browned bits (called "fond" in French cooking) and builds a deeply savory base. Tube-shaped pasta like penne or rigatoni traps the thick sauce inside each piece. This is the kind of creative fusion dish you'd find in a modern Italian trattoria.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in a large pot of salted water until **very al dente**. Drain.
2.  **The Sear:** In a large skillet, heat oil. Brown the crumbled sausage over medium-high for 5 minutes until crispy.
3.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the white wine. Scrape the bottom of the pan vigorously to release all the browned bits. Simmer for 5 minutes until reduced by half.
4.  **Bind:** Stir in the heavy cream, grainy mustard, and red pepper flakes. Simmer for 2 minutes until the sauce is thick and glossy.
5.  **Toss:** Add the hot pasta and fresh basil to the skillet. Toss for 1 minute until every noodle is coated.
6.  **Serve:** Grate fresh Parmesan over the top and serve immediately.
