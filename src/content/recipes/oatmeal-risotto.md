## Chef's Note

This is a masterclass in **Structural Science**. The secret to its elite texture is **The 8-Hour Hydration Pattern**: steel-cut oats are technically a dried grain similar to rice; by soaking them overnight, we allow the starches to fully hydrate, resulting in a "risotto-like" creaminess that has a distinct "Snap" to the bite rather than being mushy. We use **The Sweet-Savory Bridge Pattern**: the combination of mashed banana and sharp **Sherry Vinegar** creates a sophisticated flavor profile that bridges the gap between a traditional breakfast and a savory course.

## Directions

1.  **The Hydration:** In a medium bowl, combine the oats and water/broth. Cover and **let stand overnight** at room temperature.
2.  **The Acid Finish:** In a small bowl, pour the sherry vinegar over the golden raisins. Let soak while the oats cook.
3.  **Simmer:** Pour the oats and their soaking liquid into a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Add brown sugar and salt.
4.  **Cook:** Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the oats are "squeaky" to the bite (al dente).
5.  **The Emulsion:** Fold in the mashed banana. Cook for 2 more minutes until the banana has melted into the oats, creating a creamy "Bounce."
6.  **Serve:** Divide into bowls. Top with the vinegar-soaked raisins and a few generous shavings of Parmesan cheese for the final savory **High Note**.
