## Chef's Note

This is a creative fusion dish that applies risotto technique to steel-cut oats, creating a savory breakfast that blurs the line between morning and dinner. Soaking the oats overnight in broth hydrates them fully so they cook up creamy with a pleasant chewy texture, similar to arborio rice in risotto. The genius combination is mashed banana for sweetness and creaminess, balanced by sharp sherry vinegar and golden raisins for acidity. Finishing with shaved Parmesan adds a savory, salty element that makes this sophisticated enough for brunch entertaining. It's unusual but delicious - think of it as Italian risotto meets American oatmeal.

## Directions

1.  **The Hydration:** In a medium bowl, combine the oats and water/broth. Cover and **let stand overnight** at room temperature.
2.  **The Acid Balance:** In a small bowl, pour the sherry vinegar over the golden raisins. Let soak while the oats cook.
3.  **Simmer:** Pour the oats and their soaking liquid into a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Add brown sugar and salt.
4.  **Cook:** Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the oats are "squeaky" to the bite (al dente).
5.  **The Emulsion:** Fold in the mashed banana. Cook for 2 more minutes until the banana has melted into the oats, creating a creamy "Bounce."
6.  **Serve:** Divide into bowls. Top with the vinegar-soaked raisins and a few generous shavings of Parmesan cheese for the final savory **High Note**.
