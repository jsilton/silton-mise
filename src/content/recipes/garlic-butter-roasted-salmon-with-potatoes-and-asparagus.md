## Chef's Note

Potatoes take significantly longer than salmon and asparagus, so roast them at 400°F for 15 minutes before adding the protein and greens. This ensures golden potatoes while salmon stays tender and asparagus remains crisp. Lemon-butter drizzle complements both earthy vegetables and rich fish beautifully.

## Directions

1.  **Stage 1 (Potatoes):** Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss potatoes with 1 tbsp olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread in a single layer on a large rimmed baking sheet. Roast for 15 minutes.
2.  **Stage 2 (Prep):** While potatoes roast, toss asparagus with the remaining 1 tbsp oil and a pinch of salt. In a small bowl, whisk together melted butter, lemon juice, garlic, and pepper.
3.  **Stage 3 (Combine):** Move the potatoes to one side of the pan. Place the salmon portions in the center and the asparagus on the other side.
4.  **The Glaze:** Drizzle the garlic-butter mixture evenly over the salmon and asparagus.
5.  **Finish:** Return the pan to the oven and roast for 10-12 minutes until the salmon flakes easily and the asparagus is tender-crisp.
6.  **Serve:** Garnish with fresh parsley and serve immediately.
