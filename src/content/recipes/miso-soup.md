## Chef's Note

Miso soup is a miracle of **Emulsion and Timing**. The most common mistake is boiling the miso—high heat kills the delicate probiotics and ruins the aroma. Always whisk the miso with a little warm broth separately and add it only _after_ the pot has been removed from the heat. The foundation is **Dashi**: if you don't have time to make it from scratch, use "Hon-Dashi" granules for that essential oceanic umami.

## Directions

1.  **Dashi:** Bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Stir in the dashi powder (or use homemade dashi). Reduce heat to low.
2.  **Seaweed & Tofu:** Add the wakame and tofu cubes. Simmer gently for 2 minutes until the seaweed is rehydrated.
3.  **The Miso:** Place the miso paste in a small bowl. Ladle in about 1/2 cup of the hot broth. Whisk until the miso is completely smooth and liquid.
4.  **Finish:** **Turn off the heat.** Stir the miso liquid back into the pot.
5.  **Serve:** Add the green onions and serve immediately in small bowls.
