## Chef's Note
This is a masterclass in **Texture Integrity** through **The Single-Layer Roast Pattern**. The secret to Success is placing the butter-topped chicken directly onto the beets; as the chicken fat renders, it emulsifies with the orange juice and chili to create a vibrant, earthy glaze for the vegetables. We use **The Acid Finish** (fresh orange juice) to cut through the sweetness of the beets and the richness of the skin-on thighs, ensuring a bright "High Note" in every bite.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment.
2.  **The Chicken:** Place chicken thighs on the pan, spaced 3 inches apart. Top each thigh with a small pat of cold butter and a sprinkle of chili powder.
3.  **The Veg:** In a large bowl, toss the carrots, fennel, and beets with the melted butter, half the garlic, rosemary, and orange zest. 
4.  **Layer:** Arrange the vegetables around the chicken in a single layer. 
5.  **Finish:** Squeeze the orange juice over the entire pan. Season generously with salt and pepper.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 60 minutes until the chicken skin is deep golden and crispy and the beets are fork-tender.
7.  **Serve:** Serve the chicken on a bed of the citrus-glazed vegetables.
