## Chef's Note

This one-pan roast builds flavor by placing butter-topped chicken directly onto beets—as chicken fat renders, it emulsifies with orange juice and chili to create vibrant, earthy glaze for the vegetables. Fresh orange juice cuts through beets' sweetness and rich skin-on thighs, ensuring brightness in every bite.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment.
2.  **The Chicken:** Place chicken thighs on the pan, spaced 3 inches apart. Top each thigh with a small pat of cold butter and a sprinkle of chili powder.
3.  **The Veg:** In a large bowl, toss the carrots, fennel, and beets with the melted butter, half the garlic, rosemary, and orange zest.
4.  **Layer:** Arrange the vegetables around the chicken in a single layer.
5.  **Finish:** Squeeze the orange juice over the entire pan. Season generously with salt and pepper.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 60 minutes until the chicken skin is deep golden and crispy and the beets are fork-tender.
7.  **Serve:** Serve the chicken on a bed of the citrus-glazed vegetables.
