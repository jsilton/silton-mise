## Chef's Note

Sheet pan dinners became popular in the 2010s for their simplicity. The key is staged roasting: chicken and potatoes need 40+ minutes, while broccoli only needs 20. Roast the heavier items first, then add the broccoli in the center so it steams slightly from the chicken juices while still getting crispy, charred edges. The teriyaki glaze with fresh ginger adds sweet-savory flavor to tie everything together.

## Directions

1.  **Stage 1 (Heavy):** Preheat oven to 450°F. Line a rimmed sheet pan with parchment. Place drumsticks on one side and potatoes on the other. Drizzle potatoes with 1 tbsp oil, salt, and pepper. Roast for 20 minutes.
2.  **Stage 2 (Greens):** Remove the pan. Place the broccoli in the center space. Drizzle with 2 tbsp oil and a pinch of salt.
3.  **The Glaze:** Whisk the teriyaki glaze with the grated ginger. Brush the glaze generously over all sides of the chicken drumsticks.
4.  **Finish:** Return to the oven and roast for another 20-25 minutes until the broccoli is charred, potatoes are tender, and chicken reaches an internal temp of 165°F.
5.  **Serve:** Serve immediately, drizzling any extra pan juices over the potatoes for a savory "Bounce."
