## Chef's Note

This is the baseline for high-performance "Comfort" weeknights. The secret to a non-mushy sheet pan dinner is **Texture Integrity** through **Staged Roasting**. Chicken and potatoes require 40+ minutes, while broccoli only needs 20. We roast the heavy components first to develop a "Snap" on the potato skins, then add the broccoli in the center. The broccoli acts as a steam-trap for the chicken juices, ensuring the meat stays succulent while the florets get those crispy, charred edges.

## Directions

1.  **Stage 1 (Heavy):** Preheat oven to 450°F. Line a rimmed sheet pan with parchment. Place drumsticks on one side and potatoes on the other. Drizzle potatoes with 1 tbsp oil, salt, and pepper. Roast for 20 minutes.
2.  **Stage 2 (Greens):** Remove the pan. Place the broccoli in the center space. Drizzle with 2 tbsp oil and a pinch of salt.
3.  **The Glaze:** Whisk the teriyaki glaze with the grated ginger. Brush the glaze generously over all sides of the chicken drumsticks.
4.  **Finish:** Return to the oven and roast for another 20-25 minutes until the broccoli is charred, potatoes are tender, and chicken reaches an internal temp of 165°F.
5.  **Serve:** Serve immediately, drizzling any extra pan juices over the potatoes for a savory "Bounce."
