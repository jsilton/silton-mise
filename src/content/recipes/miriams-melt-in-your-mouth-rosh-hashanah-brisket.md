## Chef's Note

This is a "Traditional Recipe." The recipe utilizes a classic Jewish technique: starting the brisket at high heat (400°F) to simultaneously sear the meat and caramelize the onions without a separate pan. We then drop the temperature to 250°F for a long, slow braise. The **Balsamic and Honey** provide the acid/sugar balance that breaks down the tough connective tissue into a "melt-in-your-mouth" texture. Always slice against the grain for maximum tenderness.

## Directions

1.  **Foundation:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Lay the onion rounds in a single layer at the bottom of a heavy baking dish or Dutch oven.
2.  **Rub:** In a small bowl, mix the paprika, garlic powder, salt, and chives. Rub the mixture aggressively into every surface of the brisket.
3.  **The High Sear:** Place the brisket on top of the onions. Roast uncovered for 1 hour. This builds the "bark" and browns the onions.
4.  **The Braise:** Remove from oven. Pour the balsamic vinegar and honey over the meat. Cover the dish **extremely tightly** with a heavy lid or double layer of foil.
5.  **Low & Slow:** Lower the oven temperature to 250°F. Return the brisket to the oven and cook for 4 more hours until fork-tender.
6.  **The Chill (Optional but Recommended):** Let the meat cool in its juices, then refrigerate overnight. This allows the fat to be easily removed and the meat to be sliced perfectly thin.
7.  **Serve:** Slice against the grain. Return to the sauce and reheat gently before serving.
