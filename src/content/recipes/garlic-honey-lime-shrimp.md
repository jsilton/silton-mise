## Chef's Note

This dish is about the **"Shrimp Snap"**. By giving the shrimp a quick 5-minute alkaline rinse (baking soda) and then rinsing it off, you change the pH of the surface, resulting in a bounce and crunch that rivals the best seafood restaurants. The sauce is a classic emulsified glaze—make sure to add the lime at the end to keep the flavor bright.

## Directions

1.  **The Snap:** Toss shrimp with baking soda and a splash of water. Let sit for 5 minutes. **Rinse thoroughly** under cold water and pat bone-dry.
2.  **The Pan:** Heat butter and oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high until the butter foams.
3.  **The Sear:** Add garlic for 30 seconds (don't burn!). Add shrimp in a single layer. Sear for 2 minutes until pink.
4.  **The Glaze:** Add honey, lime juice, salt, and cayenne. Stir constantly for 1-2 minutes until the sauce bubbles and thickens into a sticky glaze that coats the shrimp.
5.  **Finish:** Garnish with parsley or cilantro and an extra squeeze of lime.
