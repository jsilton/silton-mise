## Chef's Note

To achieve the **"Bakery High-Dome"**, we use two professional techniques: **The Temperature Shock** (starting at 425°F to trigger a rapid rise, then dropping to 375°F to finish the bake) and **Resting the Batter** (letting the batter sit for 10 mins before scooping allows the starch to hydrate, resulting in a more structured, tall muffin).

## Directions

1.  **Mix:** Whisk dry ingredients in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk wet ingredients. Fold together until **just moistened** (streaks of flour are okay).
2.  **The Rest:** Let the batter sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.
3.  **Preheat:** Preheat oven to 425°F.
4.  **Portion:** Fill muffin cups to the absolute top. Sprinkle with extra sugar or chips.
5.  **The Rise:** Bake at 425°F for **5 minutes**.
6.  **The Finish:** Without opening the oven door, reduce heat to 375°F. Bake for another 12-15 minutes.
7.  **Cool:** Let cool for 10 minutes before removing from the tin.
