## Chef's Note

This is a **Modern Heritage** update to the "Wacky Cake" or "Depression Cake." The secret to its Success is **The Pan Emulsion Pattern**: we mix the entire cake directly in the baking dish, eliminating the need for bowls. The "Magic Moment" is the addition of **Apple Cider Vinegar** to the baking soda; this creates a chemical reaction that provides the mandatory "Bounce" and lift in a cake that has no eggs or butter. It results in a crumb that is surprisingly dark, moist, and "Snappy."

## Directions

1.  **The Dry Mix:** Preheat oven to 325°F. In an 8x8-inch square baking dish, whisk the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt until uniform. Use your fingers to crush any cocoa lumps.
2.  **The Wells:** Make three wells in the dry mix. Pour the oil into one, the vanilla into the second, and the vinegar into the third.
3.  **Combine:** Pour the cold water over everything. Using a fork or small whisk, stir in circular motions until a smooth batter forms. Scrape the corners of the pan carefully.
4.  **Bake:** Sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top. Wipe the edges of the dish with a damp towel for a clean "Gold Standard" look.
5.  **Cook:** Bake for 28-33 minutes until a toothpick comes out with just a few moist crumbs.
6.  **Finish:** Dust with confectioners' sugar once cool for the mandatory **High Note** visual.
