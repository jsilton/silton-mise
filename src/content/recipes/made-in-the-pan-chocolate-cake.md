## Chef's Note

This is an updated take on "Wacky Cake" or "Depression Cake." The key is mixing the entire cake directly in the baking dish, eliminating the need for bowls. The magic moment is adding apple cider vinegar to the baking soda; this creates a chemical reaction that provides lift in a cake that has no eggs or butter. It results in a crumb that is surprisingly dark, moist, and tender.

## Directions

1.  **The Dry Mix:** Preheat oven to 325°F. In an 8x8-inch square baking dish, whisk the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt until uniform. Use your fingers to crush any cocoa lumps.
2.  **The Wells:** Make three wells in the dry mix. Pour the oil into one, the vanilla into the second, and the vinegar into the third.
3.  **Combine:** Pour the cold water over everything. Using a fork or small whisk, stir in circular motions until a smooth batter forms. Scrape the corners of the pan carefully.
4.  **Bake:** Sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top. Wipe the edges of the dish with a damp towel for a clean "Kitchen Standard" look.
5.  **Cook:** Bake for 28-33 minutes until a toothpick comes out with just a few moist crumbs.
6.  **Finish:** Dust with confectioners' sugar once cool for the mandatory **High Note** visual.
