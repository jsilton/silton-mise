## Description

This is the "Lunch Anchor." Roasting fresh tomatoes concentrates their sweetness and umami, making a soup that is infinitely better than the canned version. Freezes perfectly.

## Directions

1.  **Roast:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Toss fresh tomatoes and garlic cloves with 2 tbsp olive oil, salt, and pepper. Arrange tomatoes cut-side up. Roast for 45 minutes until soft and charred.
2.  **Sauté:** While tomatoes roast, heat remaining 1 tbsp oil in a large pot. Sauté onion and red pepper flakes until soft (8 mins).
3.  **Simmer:** Add the canned tomatoes (with juice), broth, roasted tomatoes, garlic, and any juices from the pan. Simmer for 10 minutes.
4.  **Blend:** Stir in the basil. Use an immersion blender to puree until smooth (or transfer to a standard blender).
5.  **Finish:** Stir in cream if using. Taste and adjust salt.
