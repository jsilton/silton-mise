## Chef's Note

Roasting fresh tomatoes and whole garlic cloves at 400°F until charred and soft before pureeing concentrates their natural sugars and develops smoky depth that canned tomatoes lack. Blending fresh basil directly into the hot soup creates a vibrant green color and bright herbal flavor that cuts through the rich cream and sweet tomatoes.

## Directions

1.  **Roast:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss fresh tomatoes and garlic with 2 tbsp oil, salt, and pepper. Roast cut-side up for 45 minutes until charred.
2.  **Sauté:** In a large pot, sauté onion and red pepper flakes in 1 tbsp oil until soft (8 mins).
3.  **Simmer:** Add canned tomatoes, broth, and the roasted tomato-garlic mix (including all pan juices). Simmer for 15 minutes.
4.  **The Emulsion:** Stir in the fresh basil. Use an immersion blender to puree until completely velvety and smooth.
5.  **Finish:** Stir in the cream for the mandatory **Acid/Fat Finish**. Taste and adjust salt.
6.  **Serve:** Serve with a drizzle of high-quality olive oil.
