## Chef's Note

We have upgraded this from the "soup mix" version to the **Authentic French Standard**. The soul of Coq au Vin is the **Rendering of Bacon Fat** and the **Wine Reduction**. We sear the chicken in bacon fat to build a deep umami base, then simmer it in a full-bodied red wine until the sauce is dark and glossy. We finish with a **Monter au Beurre** (butter mount) to create that restaurant-quality velvety texture.

## Directions

1.  **Render:** In a large Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until crispy. Remove bacon to a plate, leaving the fat in the pot.
2.  **Sear:** Season chicken with salt and pepper. Sear in the bacon fat, skin-side down, until deep golden (8 mins). Flip and sear for 2 minutes. Remove chicken.
3.  **The Veg:** Add onion, carrots, and mushrooms to the pot. Sauté for 10 minutes until the mushrooms are browned and the onions are soft. Add garlic and tomato paste for 1 minute.
4.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the red wine. Scrape the bottom of the pot to release the fond. Bring to a boil and let it reduce by half (about 5-8 mins).
5.  **Simmer:** Return the chicken and bacon to the pot. Add stock and thyme. Reduce heat to **LOW**, cover, and simmer for 45-60 minutes until the chicken is falling off the bone.
6.  **The Magic:** Remove chicken to a plate. Turn heat to high and boil the sauce for 5 minutes until thick enough to coat a spoon.
7.  **The Mount:** Turn off the heat. Whisk in the cold butter cubes until the sauce is glossy and rich.
8.  **Serve:** Return chicken to the sauce. Serve over mashed potatoes or rice.
