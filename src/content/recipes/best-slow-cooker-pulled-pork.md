## Chef's Note

Slow cookers excel at tenderness but fail at texture. We solve this with the **Bark Finish Method**: after 8 hours of braising, we shred the meat and finish it under the **BROILER**. This evaporates the surface moisture and caramelizes the fat, giving you those crispy, charred edges that define restaurant-quality BBQ.

## Directions

1.  **Rub:** Combine all spices. Rub aggressively into the pork shoulder.
2.  **Base:** Place onion, garlic, and orange juice in the slow cooker. Add the pork.
3.  **Low & Slow:** Cook on **LOW** for 8 hours until fork-tender.
4.  **Shred:** Remove pork to a tray and shred with two forks. **Reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid.**
5.  **The Bark:** Toss the shredded pork with the reserved liquid and 1/2 cup of your favorite BBQ sauce.
6.  **Crisp:** Spread on a baking sheet. **BROIL** for 5-7 minutes until the edges are dark and crispy.
7.  **Serve:** Pile onto brioche buns.
