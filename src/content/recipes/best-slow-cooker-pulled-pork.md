## Chef's Note

Slow cookers make pork tender but can't create texture. The solution is the broiler finish: after shredding, spread the meat on a sheet pan and broil until edges crisp and char. This 5-minute step transforms soft pulled pork into something with bark and bite. Make a double batch—this freezes beautifully and becomes tacos, sandwiches, or bowl toppings all week.

## Directions

1.  **Rub:** Mix paprika, brown sugar, garlic powder, cumin, salt, and pepper. Massage into all surfaces of the pork.
2.  **Layer:** Place onion and garlic in slow cooker. Add pork. Pour orange juice and vinegar around (not over) the meat.
3.  **Cook:** Cover and cook on LOW for 8 hours until fork-tender.
4.  **Shred:** Transfer pork to a sheet pan. Shred with two forks. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking liquid.
5.  **Season:** Toss shredded pork with reserved liquid and half the BBQ sauce.
6.  **Crisp:** Spread in a single layer. Broil 5-7 minutes until edges char. Toss and broil 3 more minutes.
7.  **Serve:** Toss with remaining sauce. Pile on buns, or use for tacos and bowls.

## Instant Pot Variation

Cut pork into 4 chunks. Sear using Sauté mode. Add 12 oz Dr. Pepper (or root beer) instead of OJ, plus the vinegar. Pressure cook HIGH 60 minutes. Natural release 15 minutes. Continue from step 4.
