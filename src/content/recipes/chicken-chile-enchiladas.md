## Chef's Note

The secret to a "Kitchen Standard" enchilada is the **Tortilla Prep**. If you roll cold tortillas, they will crack; if you don't coat them in fat, they will turn to mush. We lightly sear each tortilla in a little oil for 5 seconds before dipping in the sauce—this creates a barrier that holds the structure during baking. This version focuses on the classic earthy, red-chile profile.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 375°F. In a bowl, toss shredded chicken with the green chiles and diced red pepper.
2.  **Coat:** Heat a splash of oil in a small skillet. Flash-fry each tortilla for 5 seconds per side just until pliable.
3.  **Dip & Roll:** Dip a warm tortilla into the red sauce. Place a large scoop of chicken in the center, sprinkle with a little cheese, and roll tightly. Place seam-side down in a baking dish.
4.  **Bake:** Pour the remaining sauce over the top and cover generously with cheese.
5.  **Melt:** Bake for 15-20 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and the edges of the tortillas are slightly crisp.
6.  **Serve:** Top with cold sour cream and cilantro to balance the heat.
