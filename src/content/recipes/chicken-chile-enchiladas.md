## Chef's Note

Traditional Mexican enchiladas briefly fry corn tortillas before dipping them in sauce to prevent them from becoming soggy during baking. Searing each tortilla in a little oil for just 5 seconds makes them pliable enough to roll without cracking while creating a protective layer that holds their structure. Red chile enchilada sauce delivers the classic earthy, deeply spiced profile.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 375°F. In a bowl, toss shredded chicken with the green chiles and diced red pepper.
2.  **Coat:** Heat a splash of oil in a small skillet. Flash-fry each tortilla for 5 seconds per side just until pliable.
3.  **Dip & Roll:** Dip a warm tortilla into the red sauce. Place a large scoop of chicken in the center, sprinkle with a little cheese, and roll tightly. Place seam-side down in a baking dish.
4.  **Bake:** Pour the remaining sauce over the top and cover generously with cheese.
5.  **Melt:** Bake for 15-20 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and the edges of the tortillas are slightly crisp.
6.  **Serve:** Top with cold sour cream and cilantro to balance the heat.
