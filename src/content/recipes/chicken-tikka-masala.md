## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate home version of the world's most popular curry. It strikes a perfect balance between the smoky, charred edges of the chicken and a velvety, spice-rich tomato sauce. The secret to its "restaurant" soul is the Kasuri Methi (dried fenugreek), which provides that unmistakable savory aroma that lingers in the air of the best curry houses. It is a technical dish dish that rewards the extra effort of blooming spices and simmering with a deep, complex comfort.

## Directions

1.  **The Marinade:** In a large bowl, whisk together the yogurt, garlic, ginger, lemon juice, salt, Kashmiri chili, and Garam Masala. Add the chicken chunks and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, but ideally **overnight** for the most tender results.
2.  **The Char (Broil):** Preheat your oven broiler to HIGH. Arrange the marinated chicken on a wire rack set over a foil-lined baking sheet. Broil for 10–12 minutes until you see charred, blackened spots. Do not flip. The chicken should be about 80% cooked; it will finish in the sauce.
3.  **The Base:** Heat the butter and oil in a large pot over medium heat. Sauté the onions with a pinch of salt until they are a deep, golden brown (10–15 minutes). This "low and slow" onion cook is the foundation of the gravy's body.
4.  **The Bloom:** Add the garlic, ginger, and tomato paste. Stir constantly for 2 minutes until the paste turns a dark brick-red. Reduce heat to low and add the coriander, cumin, turmeric, and paprika. Stir for 30 seconds until fragrant—do not let the spices burn.
5.  **The Simmer:** Pour in the tomato passata and the white sugar. Simmer gently for 15 minutes. The sauce should thicken and darken slightly. For a professional, silky texture, you can blend the sauce now with an immersion blender, but it is not strictly necessary.
6.  **The Finish:** Stir in the heavy cream and the broiled chicken (plus any juices from the tray). Simmer on low for 5–8 minutes to marry the flavors.
7.  **The Magic:** Turn off the heat. Stir in the cold butter for a glossy finish. Crush the Kasuri Methi between your palms to release its oils and sprinkle it over the top along with the final teaspoon of Garam Masala.
