An American-restaurant style Tikka Masala that focuses on two key techniques: broiling the chicken for a "tandoor" char, and blending the onion base for a velvety, smooth sauce. Mild-medium heat with a rich, creamy finish.

## Directions

1. Marinate: In a large bowl, whisk together the yogurt, grated garlic, ginger, lemon juice, oil, Kashmiri chili, Garam Masala, and salt. Add the chicken chunks and toss to coat. Let sit for at least 20 minutes (or overnight).
2. Broil: Preheat oven broiler to HIGH. Arrange chicken on a wire rack over a foil-lined baking sheet. Broil for 10–12 minutes until charred spots appear. Do not flip.
3. Make Base: While chicken broils, heat 2 tbsp oil in a large pot. Sauté the diced onion with a pinch of salt for 8–10 minutes until well-browned.
4. Bloom Spices: Add minced garlic, ginger, and tomato paste to the onions. Fry for 2 minutes until paste darkens. Reduce heat to medium-low and add coriander, cumin, turmeric, and Kashmiri chili. Toast for 30 seconds.
5. Simmer: Stir in tomato puree (passata), water, and sugar. Simmer gently for 10–12 minutes.
6. Blend: Carefully transfer the sauce to a blender (or use an immersion blender) and blend until completely smooth. Return to the pot.
7. Finish: Stir in the heavy cream. Add the broiled chicken (and any juices from the pan). Simmer on low for 5–8 minutes.
8. Serve: Turn off the heat. Stir in the butter. Crush the Kasuri Methi in your palms and sprinkle it over the curry along with the final tsp of Garam Masala.

## Notes

Kasuri Methi is essential for the restaurant aroma.**Kashmiri Chili Powder **provides the red color without excessive heat; do not substitute with full Cayenne or it will be too spicy.If the sauce is too thick, splash in a little extra water or chicken stock.
