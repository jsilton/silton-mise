## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate holiday **Project**. The secret to a bird that is succulent rather than dry is **Structural Science** through **The 3-Day Dry Brine Pattern**. You must rub the turkey with salt and lemon zest and refrigerate it uncovered for at least 24 hours; this draws moisture out of the skin (ensuring a glass-like "Snap") while seasoning the meat to the bone. We use **Hard Apple Cider** in the roasting pan as a "Sweet Pulse" that prevents the drippings from burning and infuses the meat with a sophisticated harvest aroma.

## Directions

1.  **The Brine:** Rub turkey with salt, pepper, and lemon zest. Place in a massive bag with half the herbs and garlic. **Refrigerate for 1-3 days**, flipping once.
2.  **The Dehydrate:** 12 hours before roasting, remove from bag. Pat **bone-dry** and leave uncovered in the fridge—this is mandatory for crispy skin.
3.  **Thermal Prep:** Bring turkey to room temp for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 450°F.
4.  **The Pan:** Pour cider and 1/2 cup wine into the pan. Stuff the cavity with remaining onions, lemon, and garlic. Brush the skin with melted butter.
5.  **Sear:** Roast breast-side up for 30 minutes. Cover the breast with foil to prevent over-browning.
6.  **Bake:** Reduce heat to 350°F. Roast for 1.5 - 2 hours until the thigh reaches **165°F**.
7.  **The Set:** Transfer to a board and **let rest for 30 minutes** (mandatory for moisture).
