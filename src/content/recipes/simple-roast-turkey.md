## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate holiday centerpiece. The secret to a bird that is succulent rather than dry is dry brining: rub the turkey with salt and lemon zest and refrigerate it uncovered for at least 24 hours. This draws moisture out of the skin (ensuring crisp, golden skin) while seasoning the meat to the bone. Hard apple cider in the roasting pan prevents the drippings from burning and infuses the meat with a sophisticated harvest aroma.

## Directions

1.  **The Brine:** Rub turkey with salt, pepper, and lemon zest. Place in a massive bag with half the herbs and garlic. **Refrigerate for 1-3 days**, flipping once.
2.  **The Dehydrate:** 12 hours before roasting, remove from bag. Pat **bone-dry** and leave uncovered in the fridge—this is mandatory for crispy skin.
3.  **Thermal Prep:** Bring turkey to room temp for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 450°F.
4.  **The Pan:** Pour cider and 1/2 cup wine into the pan. Stuff the cavity with remaining onions, lemon, and garlic. Brush the skin with melted butter.
5.  **Sear:** Roast breast-side up for 30 minutes. Cover the breast with foil to prevent over-browning.
6.  **Bake:** Reduce heat to 350°F. Roast for 1.5 - 2 hours until the thigh reaches **165°F**.
7.  **The Finish:** Transfer to a board and **let rest for 30 minutes** (mandatory for moisture).
