## Chef's Note

This is the **Solomonov Method** for the smoothest hummus on earth. The secret is two-fold: **Baking Soda** in the water breaks down the chickpea skins until they are mushy, and the **Ice Cube Trick** creates a temperature shock during blending that emulsifies the fat and water into a pale, airy cream. We blend the tahini and lemon _first_ to create a "Tahini Sauce" base, then add the chickpeas while they are still hot.

## Directions

1.  **The Soak:** Soak chickpeas with 1 tsp baking soda in plenty of water for 12 hours.
2.  **The Over-Cook:** Drain and rinse. Place in a pot with the remaining 1 tsp baking soda and fresh water. Boil for 45-60 minutes until the chickpeas are literally falling apart and the skins are translucent. **Do not drain until you are ready to blend.**
3.  **The Tahini Base:** In a food processor, blend the garlic, lemon juice, and salt until pureed. Let sit for 10 minutes to mellow the garlic, then strain out the solids.
4.  **The Emulsion:** Add the tahini to the lemon juice. Process until it thickens and turns pale. With the motor running, add 1/4 cup ice-cold water and **2 ice cubes**. Process until it looks like whipped cream.
5.  **The Combine:** Drain the **hot** chickpeas. Add them to the food processor with the cumin. Process for at least 4-5 minutes. If it's too thick, add a tablespoon of the chickpea cooking liquid.
6.  **Serve:** Spread in a shallow bowl. Make a well in the center. Drizzle with plenty of olive oil and a sprinkle of paprika or za'atar.
