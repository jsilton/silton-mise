title: Israeli-Style Hummus
servings: About 4 cups
ingredients:
  - 1 cup dried chickpeas
  - '2 teaspoons baking soda, divided'
  - '4 garlic cloves, unpeeled'

  - 1/4 teaspoon (or more) ground cumin
  - Olive oil (for serving)

## Directions

1. Place chickpeas and 1 teaspoon baking soda in a medium bowl and add cold water to cover by 2". Cover and let sit at room temperature until chickpeas have doubled in size, 8–12 hours. Drain and rinse.
2. Combine soaked chickpeas and remaining 1 teaspoon baking soda in a large saucepan and add cold water to cover by at least 2". Bring to a boil, skimming surface as needed. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and simmer until chickpeas are tender and really falling apart, 45–60 minutes. Drain; set aside.
3. Meanwhile, process garlic, lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon salt in a food processor until coarsely pureed; let sit 10 minutes to allow garlic to mellow.
4. Strain garlic mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl, pressing on solids to release as much liquid as possible. Return liquid to food processor; discard solids. Add tahini and pulse to combine. With motor running, add 1/4 cup ice water by the tablespoonful and process (it may seize up at first) until mixture is very smooth, pale, and thick. Add chickpeas and cumin and process, occasionally scraping down sides, until mixture is extremely smooth, about 4 minutes. Thin with more water if you prefer a looser consistency; taste and season with salt, more lemon juice, and more cumin as desired.
5. Spoon hummus into a shallow bowl, making a well in the center, and drizzle liberally with oil. Top as desired.
