## Chef's Note

This is the baseline for high-speed **Modularity**. The secret to a Rice Krispie treat that isn't a rock-hard brick is **Culinary Technique** through **The Low-Heat Emulsion Method**. You must melt the butter and marshmallows on the **lowest possible heat**; high heat denatures the sugar and leads to a brittle "Snap." We use **Sea Salt and Vanilla** as the mandatory high notes to balance the corn-syrup sweetness, providing a sophisticated Texture that commercial versions lack.

## Directions

1.  **The Melt:** In a large heavy-bottomed pot, melt butter over **low heat**. Add marshmallows and stir constantly with a greased spatula until 90% melted.
2.  **Emulsify:** Remove from heat immediately. Stir in the sea salt and vanilla extract.
3.  **The Fold:** Gently fold in the cereal until every grain is coated in the marshmallow silk.
4.  **The Press:** Transfer to a greased 9x13-inch pan. Use a piece of wax paper to **press down very gently**—if you pack them too tight, you destroy the Texture air pockets.
5.  **The Finish:** Let cool completely at room temperature for 30 minutes. **Do not refrigerate.**
6.  **Cut:** Slice into 2-inch squares and serve the same day for the Kitchen Standard texture.
