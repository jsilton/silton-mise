## Chef's Note

The key to Rice Krispie treats that aren't rock-hard is melting the butter and marshmallows on the lowest possible heat. High heat denatures the sugar and leads to brittle treats. We add sea salt and vanilla extract to balance the corn-syrup sweetness, providing a more sophisticated flavor than commercial versions.

## Directions

1.  **The Melt:** In a large heavy-bottomed pot, melt butter over **low heat**. Add marshmallows and stir constantly with a greased spatula until 90% melted.
2.  **Emulsify:** Remove from heat immediately. Stir in the sea salt and vanilla extract.
3.  **The Fold:** Gently fold in the cereal until every grain is coated in the marshmallow silk.
4.  **The Press:** Transfer to a greased 9x13-inch pan. Use a piece of wax paper to **press down very gently**—if you pack them too tight, you destroy the Texture air pockets.
5.  **The Finish:** Let cool completely at room temperature for 30 minutes. **Do not refrigerate.**
6.  **Cut:** Slice into 2-inch squares and serve the same day for the Kitchen Standard texture.
