## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
2. Put 1 cup (170g) semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chips and 8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter in a microwave-safe bowl, and heat until the butter is melted and the chips are soft. Stir until the chips melt, reheating briefly if necessary. You can also do this over a burner set at very low heat. Transfer the melted chocolate/butter to a mixing bowl.
3. Espresso enhances chocolate's flavor much as vanilla does; using 1 teaspoon will simply enhance the flavor, while 2 teaspoons will lend a hint of mocha to the cake.
4. Add 3 large eggs, beating briefly until smooth. Finally, add 1/2 cup (43g) cocoa powder, and mix just to combine.
5. Grease an 8” round cake pan, and line it with parchment. Cut it to size by laying the pan atop the parchment, drawing a circle around it with a marking pen, then cutting it out. Lay the parchment in the pan, and grease the parchment.
6. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.
7. Bake the cake for 25 minutes; the top will form a thin crust, and it'll puff up nicely.
8. Remove the cake from the oven; it should register at least 200°F on an instant-read thermometer inserted into its center.
9. This cake is actually a bit over-baked; I should have lowered the temperature a couple of minutes, because I was using a darker (dark gray) pan.
10. A toothpick inserted into the center of the cake should come out with moist crumbs clinging to it; again, this is slightly over-baked, as evidenced by the paucity of crumbs.
11. Cool the cake in the pan for 5 minutes, then loosen the edges with a table knife or nylon spreader, and turn it out onto a serving plate. The top will now be on the bottom; that's fine. Also, the edges may crumble a bit, which is also fine.
12. Allow the cake to cool completely before glazing. When ready to glaze, slip strips of parchment under the edges of the cake, to catch any drips.
13. To make the icing/ganache, heat 1 cup (170g) semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup (113g) heavy cream together until the cream is steaming. Remove from the heat, and stir until the mixture comes together.
14. Keep stirring; don't give up. All of a sudden, you'll have beautifully smooth, creamy chocolate icing, a.k.a. chocolate ganache.
15. Immediately pour the ganache over the cake.
16. Isn't that beautiful?
17. Spread the ganache to the edges of the cake, encouraging it to drip down the sides. It doesn't need much encouragement once you push it to the edge.
18. Once the ganache sets, gently pull away the strips of parchment; you'll be happy at how neat and clean your plate looks.
19. For cleanest slicing, use a sharp knife dipped in hot water and wiped dry. Repeat dipping knife in hot water and wiping dry for each slice.
20. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream; or just as it is, in all its chocolate-y splendor.
21. If you're celebrating Passover, I hope you enjoy a lovely family celebration. If not – well, go ahead and enjoy this cake anyway!
