## Chef's Note

This is the classic flourless chocolate cake for Passover and gluten-free celebrations. The key to its texture is melting high-quality chocolate directly into hot cream off the heat to create a mirror-shiny glaze that provides a contrast to the dense, fudgy cake. We use espresso powder for complexity—it doesn't make the cake taste like coffee; instead, it amplifies the natural fruitiness of the cocoa.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** Preheat oven to 375°F. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt 1 cup chocolate chips and the butter in 30-second bursts until smooth.
2.  **Flavor:** Whisk in the espresso powder, vanilla, and salt. Add the eggs **one at a time**, beating briefly until the batter is glossy.
3.  **Incorporate:** Sift in the cocoa powder and sugar. Fold gently until **just combined**.
4.  **Bake:** Grease an 8-inch round pan and line with parchment. Pour in the batter. Bake for 25 minutes until the top forms a thin, crackly crust and the internal temp is 200°F.
5.  **Cool:** Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then invert onto a serving plate. Allow to cool completely before glazing.
6.  **The Glaze:** Heat 1/2 cup heavy cream until steaming. Pour over 1 cup chocolate chips. Let sit for 5 minutes, then whisk until mirror-glossy.
7.  **Finish:** Pour the ganache over the center of the cake, encouraging it to drip down the sides for **Textural Balance**.
