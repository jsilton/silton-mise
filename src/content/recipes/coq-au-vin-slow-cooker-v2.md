## Directions

1. Brown the Chicken: Season chicken thighs with pepper. Brown them in a skillet on both sides (about 3-4 minutes total).
2. Prepare Veggie Base: Spray the crockpot with cooking spray. Add the minced garlic, carrot chunks, frozen pearl onions, and the thick-sliced, de-stemmed mushrooms.
3. Stack: Place the browned chicken thighs on top of the vegetables.
4. Make the Slurry: In a small cup, whisk the cornstarch into the red wine until it is completely dissolved (no lumps). Stir in the Worcestershire sauce and dried thyme.
5. Add Liquid: Pour the wine/cornstarch mixture directly over the chicken.
6. Season: Sprinkle the Beefy Onion Soup Mix and a generous amount of Garlic Powder over the top.
7. Cook: Cover and cook on High for 2 ½ – 3 hours.
8. Serve: Serve hot over rice.

## Notes

Mushrooms: Use Baby Bellas (Cremini) for meatier texture; slice thick so they don't dissolve.Onions: Frozen pearl onions are used for better texture and zero prep. No need to thaw before adding. Thickener: The cornstarch is whisked into the cold wine to prevent lumps.
