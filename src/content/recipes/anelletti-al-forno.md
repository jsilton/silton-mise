## Chef's Note

Anelletti al Forno is a traditional Sicilian pasta bake, often served on special occasions and holidays, particularly New Year's Day. The name comes from 'anelletti,' meaning 'little rings,' the small ring-shaped pasta traditional to Sicily. This dish reflects Sicily's complex culinary history - the cinnamon and nutmeg hint at Arab influence, while the cheese and meat sauce show Italian traditions. Unlike American baked ziti, this is a structured dish that's sliced like a cake, with a crispy exterior and creamy interior. The hard-boiled eggs throughout are traditional and add richness.

## Directions

1.  **The Ragu:** Sauté the carrot, celery, and onion in oil until soft (15 mins). Brown the beef and pork. Deglaze with red wine. Stir in tomato paste, tomatoes, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Simmer on **LOW** for 2 hours until thick and dark. Stir in peas at the end.
2.  **The Eggplant:** Salt eggplant cubes for 30 mins, rinse, and pat dry. Fry in 1 inch of oil until deep golden. Drain on paper towels.
3.  **The Pasta:** Boil anelletti in salted water until **very al dente** (2 minutes less than package). Drain.
4.  **Toss:** In a massive bowl, toss the pasta with 4 cups of the ragu and the fried eggplant.
5.  **Layer:** In a greased 9x13 dish, layer half the pasta. Top with chopped eggs, ham, and half the cheeses. Cover with remaining pasta.
6.  **The Crown:** Top with remaining cheese and breadcrumbs.
7.  **Bake:** Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes until bubbling.
8.  **Rest (Critical):** Let sit for 15 minutes before slicing. This allows the pasta "cake" to set so it doesn't collapse.
