## Directions

1. In a large bowl, whisk 1/2 cup of the olive oil with the paprika. Add the chicken and toss to coat; let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the yogurt, lemon juice, cayenne, crushed red pepper and the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Season with salt and black pepper and mix well.
3. Light a grill. Season the chicken with salt and black pepper and thread 3 pieces onto each of 8 skewers. Oil the grate and grill the chicken over moderate heat, turning occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Transfer the skewers to a serving platter and serve with the yogurt sauce and lemon wedges.
