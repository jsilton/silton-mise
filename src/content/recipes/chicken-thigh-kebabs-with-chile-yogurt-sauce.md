## Chef's Note

This is a high-protein meal that relies on proper marinating for tenderness. By using Greek yogurt in the sauce and lemon juice as a tenderizer, we break down the chicken's muscle fibers before they hit the high heat of the grill. The paprika-oil marinade provides color and a slight char. Always use skin-on thighs if possible—the rendered fat provides flavor that skinless meat lacks.

## Directions

1.  **The Paprika Rub:** In a large bowl, whisk 1/2 cup olive oil with the paprika. Toss the chicken pieces to coat. Let stand at room temperature for 15-20 minutes.
2.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk yogurt, lemon juice, cayenne, red pepper flakes, and the remaining 1 tbsp olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Chill until ready to serve.
3.  **Skewer:** Thread 3 chicken pieces onto each of 8 skewers. Season the outside of the kebabs with salt and pepper.
4.  **Grill:** Preheat grill to medium-high. Oil the grates. Grill kebabs for 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until the skin is crispy and the internal temp is 165°F.
5.  **Serve:** Transfer to a platter. Serve immediately with the chilled yogurt sauce and lemon wedges.
