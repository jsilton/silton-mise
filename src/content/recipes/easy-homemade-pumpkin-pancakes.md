## Chef's Note

Pumpkin puree adds weight and moisture that can make pancakes rubbery. Mix dry into wet ingredients until just combined - a few small lumps are fine and actually prevent tough, overworked gluten. Whisking until completely smooth destroys the fluffy texture.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, spice mix, and salt.
2.  **Wet Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk milk, pumpkin puree, egg, and oil until perfectly smooth and emulsified.
3.  **Combine:** Gradually add the dry mix to the pumpkin mixture. Stir with a spatula until the large clumps disappear. **Stop stirring immediately**—even if there are tiny lumps.
4.  **The Rest:** Let the batter sit for 5 minutes while you heat the griddle (The Hydration Rest).
5.  **Prep:** Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or oil spray.
6.  **Pour:** Use a 1/4 cup scoop to drop batter onto the skillet.
7.  **Flip:** Cook for about 2 minutes until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look matte and dry. Flip and cook for 1-2 more minutes until golden brown.
8.  **Serve:** Serve with salted butter and warm maple syrup.
