## Directions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, pumpkin spice mix, and salt.
2. In another bowl, whisk the milk, pumpkin puree, egg, and oil until blended.
3. While stirring, slowly add the flour mixture into the pumpkin mixture until blended; try not to over mix the batter. As soon as you see large clumps of flour disappear, stop stirring.
4. Lightly spray hot skillet or griddle with non-stick cooking spray or lightly brush with melted butter. Then, use a 1/4-cup measuring cup to spoon batter onto the skillet or griddle.
5. When you begin to notice the edges of the pancake look dry and little bubbles start to appear on the top surfaces of the pancake, turn over. This takes about 2 minutes. Once flipped, cook another 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly browned and cooked in the middle.
