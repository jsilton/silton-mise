## Chef's Note
The secret to "Restaurant Quality" French toast is the **Modern Heritage** bread choice. We exclusively use **Challah or Brioche** for their high egg and butter content, which creates a custardy "Bounce" that regular white bread cannot mimic. We use the **Quick-Dip Pattern**: because these breads are porous, you must only dip them for 2-3 seconds per side. Over-soaking will cause the structural gluten to collapse, leading to a soggy center. The warm honey provides the mandatory **High Note** sweetness.

## Directions

1.  **The Spice:** In a small bowl, whisk cinnamon, nutmeg, and warmed honey until no clumps remain.
2.  **The Custard:** In a shallow dish (like a pie plate), whisk together the honey-spice mix, eggs, milk, and vanilla until perfectly smooth.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat 2 tbsp butter in a large skillet over medium.
4.  **Dip:** Working in batches, dip a slice of bread into the custard for exactly **2 seconds per side**. Let the excess drip off.
5.  **Cook:** Immediately place in the skillet. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side until deep golden brown and slightly crisped at the edges.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with warm maple syrup and fresh berries for the mandatory **Acid/Sweet Finish**.
