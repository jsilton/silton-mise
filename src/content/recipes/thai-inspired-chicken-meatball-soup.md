## Chef's Note

The secret to chicken meatballs that aren't dry is **Culinary Technique** through **The Aromatic Bind Method**. By grating the ginger and garlic into a paste _before_ mixing with the meat, we introduce a massive amount of cellular moisture that protects the lean protein during the sear. We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Staged Simmer**: we sear the meatballs to develop a "Snap," then simmer them in the coconut broth for only 5 minutes. The fresh lime juice provides the mandatory **Acid Balance**.

## Directions

1.  **The Mix:** In a large bowl, combine chicken, half the ginger paste, half the garlic, the jalapeño, cilantro, and 2 tbsp fish sauce. Mix **gently** until tacky.
2.  **Shape:** Form into 2-inch meatballs.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat 2 tbsp oil in a Dutch oven. Brown meatballs in batches (5 mins) until golden. Remove to a plate.
4.  **The Base:** Wipe the pot. Sauté the remaining ginger/garlic for 1 minute. Add broth, coconut milk, sugar, and remaining fish sauce. Bring to a simmer.
5.  **Bind:** Return meatballs to the pot. Simmer for 5-8 minutes until cooked through.
6.  **Wilt:** Remove from heat. Stir in the baby spinach and lime juice.
7.  **Serve:** Serve hot over [Basmati Rice](/silton-mise/recipes/basmati-rice).
