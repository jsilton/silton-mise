## Chef's Note

This is the baseline **Updated Classic** update for a low-carb nutritious side. The secret to a non-watery cauliflower mash is **Textural Balance** through the **Dry-Steam Method**. You must drain the cauliflower and then pat it **bone-dry** with paper towels before pureeing. Any residual water will turn the mash into a soup. We use **The Better Than Bouillon Hack**: a tiny amount of concentrated base provides the savory depth usually found in real potatoes.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add cauliflower florets and cook for 6-8 minutes until fork-tender.
2.  **The Dry Method:** Drain the cauliflower immediately. Do not let it cool. Place the hot florets between layers of paper towels and **press firmly** to remove all excess moisture.
3.  **The Emulsion:** Place the hot, dry cauliflower in a food processor or use an immersion blender. Add the cream cheese, Parmesan, garlic, bouillon base, and pepper.
4.  **Pulverize:** Process until completely smooth and velvety (about 1 minute).
5.  **Finish:** Stir in the butter. Garnish with fresh chives for the mandatory **High Note**.
6.  **Serve:** Serve hot with an extra pat of butter on top.
