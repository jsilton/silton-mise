## Chef's Note

The secret to a "Kitchen Standard" scampi is **Culinary Technique** through **The Mounting Method**. We reduce the white wine and lemon juice by half _before_ whisking in the cold butter; this creates a stable, velvety emulsion that "Bounces" against the pasta rather than separating into oil. We maintain **Textural Balance** by searing the shrimp for only 1 minute per side until they are pink but slightly underdone—they will finish cooking in the residual heat of the butter sauce, ensuring they stay "Snappy."

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook linguini in salted water until **very al dente**. Drain.
2.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet, heat 2 tbsp oil over medium. Sauté shrimp for 1 minute per side until pink. Remove immediately to a plate.
3.  **Aromatics:** Add 1 tbsp oil, garlic, shallots, and red pepper flakes. Sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.
4.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the wine and lemon juice. Increase heat to high and boil for 2 minutes until reduced by half.
5.  **Emulsify:** Reduce heat to low. Whisk in the butter and remaining 2 tbsp oil until the sauce is thick and glossy.
6.  **Bind:** Return the shrimp and any juices to the pan. Add the hot pasta and parsley. Toss for 1 minute until every strand is coated.
7.  **Serve:** Season with salt and plenty of black pepper. Top with Parmesan and serve immediately.
