## Chef's Note

Scampi is actually Italian for langoustine (a small lobster), but Italian-American restaurants in the 1920s started using the term for any shellfish cooked in garlic, butter, and white wine. The dish as we know it is completely American - you won't find 'shrimp scampi' in Italy. The massive amount of butter and garlic is distinctly Italian-American excess, taking Italian flavors and amplifying them. Shrimp overcooks in seconds - they're done when they just turn pink and curl into a C shape; if they curl into an O, they're overcooked. The butter emulsion technique creates a sauce that clings rather than separates into puddles.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook linguini in salted water until **very al dente**. Drain.
2.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet, heat 2 tbsp oil over medium. Sauté shrimp for 1 minute per side until pink. Remove immediately to a plate.
3.  **Aromatics:** Add 1 tbsp oil, garlic, shallots, and red pepper flakes. Sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.
4.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the wine and lemon juice. Increase heat to high and boil for 2 minutes until reduced by half.
5.  **Emulsify:** Reduce heat to low. Whisk in the butter and remaining 2 tbsp oil until the sauce is thick and glossy.
6.  **Bind:** Return the shrimp and any juices to the pan. Add the hot pasta and parsley. Toss for 1 minute until every strand is coated.
7.  **Serve:** Season with salt and plenty of black pepper. Top with Parmesan and serve immediately.
