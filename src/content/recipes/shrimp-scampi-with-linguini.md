## Directions

1. Whisk grated garlic, salt, and 1 Tbsp. oil in a medium bowl. Add shrimp, toss to coat, and chill, uncovered, at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.
2. Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium and cook shrimp mixture, being careful not to let shrimp or garlic brown, until shrimp is pink but still slightly underdone, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon, leaving as much oil in pan as possible. Add sliced garlic, shallots and red pepper to skillet and cook, tossing, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and lemon juice and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Add butter and remaining 2 Tbsp. oil and cook, stirring and swirling pan occasionally, until butter is melted and sauce is thickened, about 2-4 minutes more.
3. When the butter has melted, return the shrimp to the pan. Stir well and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle over a bit more olive oil and serve immediately. Combine with the along with the parsley and cooked pasta and toss to coat. Transfer to a platter, and top with shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
