## Chef's Note
The secret to "Gold Standard" gnocchi is skipping the pot of boiling water. We use **Texture Integrity** through the **High-Heat Roast Pattern**: roasting the gnocchi directly on a sheet pan at 450°F. This creates a "Snap" on the outside while keeping the center pillow-soft. We pair this with cherry tomatoes that "pop" in the oven, creating a natural **Acid Finish** that emulsifies with the olive oil and garlic to coat the gnocchi in a rustic sauce.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 450°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2.  **Toss:** In a large bowl, combine gnocchi, peppers, tomatoes, onion, and smashed garlic. Drizzle with olive oil and add rosemary, salt, and plenty of black pepper. Toss until every piece is glossy.
3.  **Spread:** Spread the mixture in a **single layer** on the baking sheet. (If the pan is too crowded, the gnocchi will steam rather than crisp).
4.  **Roast:** Bake for 18-20 minutes, stirring once halfway through, until the gnocchi are plump and golden brown and the peppers are tender and charred at the edges.
5.  **Finish:** Remove from the oven. Immediately toss with the fresh basil and a generous amount of grated Parmesan.
6.  **Serve:** Serve in deep bowls while the gnocchi is at its peak crispiness.
