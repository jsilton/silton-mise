## Chef's Note

This is a modern Italian-American technique from the 2010s that revolutionized gnocchi cooking by skipping the pot of boiling water entirely. Shelf-stable gnocchi from the grocery store can go straight from package to sheet pan - roasting at 450°F creates a crispy golden crust on the outside while keeping the center pillowy soft. The cherry tomatoes burst in the oven, releasing their juices which emulsify with the olive oil and garlic to create a rustic sauce. Make sure to spread everything in a single layer - crowding the pan will steam the gnocchi instead of crisping it.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 450°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2.  **Toss:** In a large bowl, combine gnocchi, peppers, tomatoes, onion, and smashed garlic. Drizzle with olive oil and add rosemary, salt, and plenty of black pepper. Toss until every piece is glossy.
3.  **Spread:** Spread the mixture in a **single layer** on the baking sheet. (If the pan is too crowded, the gnocchi will steam rather than crisp).
4.  **Roast:** Bake for 18-20 minutes, stirring once halfway through, until the gnocchi are plump and golden brown and the peppers are tender and charred at the edges.
5.  **Finish:** Remove from the oven. Immediately toss with the fresh basil and a generous amount of grated Parmesan.
6.  **Serve:** Serve in deep bowls while the gnocchi is at its peak crispiness.
