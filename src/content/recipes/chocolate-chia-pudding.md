## Chef's Note

The secret to a "Kitchen Standard" chia pudding is **The Blender Method**. Many recipes leave the seeds whole, which can result in a gritty, uneven texture. By blending the seeds on high speed, we break them down until they are undetectable, creating a silky, mousse-like consistency that feels like a "Comfort" dessert but provides the nutritious of a superfood. Always let it chill for at least 3 hours to allow the fibers to fully set into a "Bounce."

## Directions

1.  **Blend:** Combine almond milk, chia seeds, maple syrup, cocoa powder, vanilla, and salt in a high-powered blender.
2.  **Pulverize:** Start on low and gradually increase to high. Blend for 60 seconds until the mixture is completely smooth and the seeds have disappeared.
3.  **The Finish:** Transfer the mixture to individual jars or a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate for **at least 3 hours** (or overnight) until thick and set.
4.  **Serve:** Stir once before serving. Top with fresh berries and nuts for **Textural Balance**.
