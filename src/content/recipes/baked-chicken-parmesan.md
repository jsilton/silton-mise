## Chef's Note

The common flaw in Baked Chicken Parm is the "Soggy Bottom." We solve this with **Texture Integrity**: we bread the chicken with Panko and Parmesan and bake it at high heat until it's a crispy cutlet _before_ adding the sauce. By only spooning the sauce over the center of the chicken, we keep the edges shatteringly crisp. Always serve with a bright acid-forward salad to cut the heavy cheese.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Set up a breading station: one bowl with beaten eggs, one bowl with Panko and Parmesan mixed.
2.  **Bread:** Season chicken with salt and pepper. Dip in egg, then press firmly into the panko mixture until fully coated.
3.  **Crisp:** Place chicken on a wire rack set over a baking sheet (this allows air to circulate, preventing a soggy bottom). Bake for 15-18 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.
4.  **Top:** Remove from oven. Spoon 2 tbsp of marinara over the _center_ of each piece of chicken. Top with a slice of mozzarella.
5.  **Melt:** Return to the oven for 3-5 minutes, or under the **BROIL** setting, until the cheese is bubbly and browned.
6.  **Serve:** Serve alongside your pasta tossed in the remaining sauce. Garnish with fresh basil.
