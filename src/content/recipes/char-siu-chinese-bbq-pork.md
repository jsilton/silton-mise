## Chef's Note

This is a more traditional char siu using pork butt (shoulder) instead of tenderloin. The extra fat keeps the meat juicy through high-heat roasting. Placing a tray of water underneath the roasting rack catches drippings and prevents smoking while creating a humid environment that keeps the pork tender. The honey glaze lacquers the outside into a sticky, caramelized coating. For extra char, finish under the broiler for the last 5 minutes.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** Whisk all marinade ingredients. Toss the pork strips in the sauce. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours (overnight).
2.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 475°F. Place a wire rack over a foil-lined baking sheet. Pour 1 cup of water into the bottom of the sheet.
3.  **Roast:** Place pork on the rack. Roast at 475°F for 10 minutes.
4.  **Glaze:** Reduce heat to 375°F. Roast for another 30-40 minutes, removing the pan every 10 minutes to brush the pork with the remaining marinade.
5.  **Finish:** In the final 5 minutes, you can turn on the **BROILER** to get those charred "burned ends."
6.  **Rest:** Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing into thin medallions.
