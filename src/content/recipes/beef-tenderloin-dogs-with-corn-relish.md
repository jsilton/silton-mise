## Chef's Note

This is a high-end take on a cookout classic. The beef tenderloin is incredibly tender, so we treat it with **High-Heat Minimalist Cooking**: a hard sear to get a crust while keeping the center medium-rare. The **Corn Relish** provides the essential Executive "Acid Crunch" that makes this dish feel light and balanced rather than heavy.

## Directions

1.  **The Relish:** In a small bowl, whisk the vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper. Toss with the roasted corn, peppers, and onions. Let marinate while you cook the beef.
2.  **The Beef:** Rub the tenderloin strips with oil, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill to high. Sear the beef "dogs" for 2-3 minutes per side until charred on the outside and 125°F in the center. Let rest for 5 minutes.
4.  **The Bread:** Toast the baguette or brioche buns until golden.
5.  **Assemble:** Place a beef strip in each bun. Top generously with the corn relish.
