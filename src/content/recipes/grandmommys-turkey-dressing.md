## Chef's Note

This is the soul of the Executive Thanksgiving. The secret to its elite texture is **The Crumble Method**: we bake a fresh tray of cornbread from scratch and then combine it with crumbled stale white bread. This mix of grain structures ensures the dressing has both Texture and Crunch rather than turning into a uniform mush. We have upgraded the legacy margarine to **Unsalted Butter** for a cleaner, holiday-worthy flavor. The "Golden Rule" is the broth addition: pour just until it reaches the top of the bread—any more and you'll lose the **Textural Balance**.

## Directions

1.  **The Cornbread:** Preheat oven to 400°F. In a large bowl, whisk together corn meal, flour, milk, melted butter, and eggs. Pour into an 8-inch square pan and bake for 40 minutes until golden. Let cool completely.
2.  **The Mix:** In a massive bowl, crumble the entire tray of cooled cornbread. Add the 6-7 slices of crumbled white bread.
3.  **Aromatics:** Fold in the finely chopped celery and onion. Season with poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper.
4.  **The Hydration:** Gradually pour in the chicken broth. Stir gently until the mixture is very moist but not swimming in liquid (aim for the consistency of wet stuffing).
5.  **Bake:** Transfer to a large greased baking dish. Bake at 350°F for 50-60 minutes until the top is deep golden brown and the edges are crispy.
6.  **Serve:** Serve hot alongside turkey and cranberry sauce.
