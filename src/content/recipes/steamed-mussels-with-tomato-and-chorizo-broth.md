## Chef's Note

The secret to "Kitchen Standard" mussels is **Culinary Technique** through **The Reduction Method**. We cook the chorizo, garlic, and cherry tomatoes until the tomatoes burst and the wine reduces by half _before_ adding the mussels. This creates a thick, savory Texture to the broth that a standard boil lacks. We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Fennel Pulse**: crushed fennel seeds provide an herbal Crunch that echoes the oceanic sweetness of the mussels. Always serve with charred bread to soak up the mandatory **Acid Balance**.

## Directions

1.  **The Render:** In a large heavy pot, heat oil. Sauté chorizo for 4 minutes until crispy. Add garlic and fennel seeds; cook for 1 minute.
2.  **The Glaze:** Add tomatoes and wine. Season with black pepper. Simmer for 6-8 minutes over medium-high until the liquid has reduced by 3/4 and looks like a thick syrup.
3.  **The Crunch:** Add the mussels to the pot. Cover tightly.
4.  **Steam:** Cook for 6-8 minutes, shaking the pot occasionally, until all mussels have popped open.
5.  **Refine:** Discard any mussels that did not open.
6.  **Serve:** Ladle mussels and the thick chorizo broth into deep bowls. Garnish with fresh tarragon for the mandatory aromatic **High Note**.
7.  **Toast:** Serve with heavily oiled, charred country bread.
