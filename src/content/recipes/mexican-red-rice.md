## Chef's Note

The secret to fluffy, distinct Mexican rice is **Toasting**. You must fry the dry rice in oil until it is opaque and smells like popcorn. This creates a protective seal around each grain so they don't turn into a mushy clump when you add the tomato liquid. This is the **Structural Science** of great rice.

## Directions

1.  **Rinse:** Rinse the rice until the water runs clear. **Dry thoroughly** (moisture will prevent toasting).
2.  **Toast:** Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the rice. Stir constantly for 3-5 minutes until the rice is opaque and golden brown.
3.  **Aromatics:** Stir in the onion and garlic. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
4.  **Liquid:** Pour in the tomato puree, broth, and salt. Bring to a boil.
5.  **Simmer:** Place the cilantro sprig on top. Cover tightly, reduce heat to the lowest setting, and simmer for 15-18 minutes until the liquid is absorbed.
6.  **Rest:** Turn off the heat. **Keep the lid on** for 10 minutes.
7.  **Serve:** Remove cilantro, fluff with a fork, and serve.
