## Chef's Note

This is a high-protein, flourless breakfast. The challenge is **Structural Integrity**: without flour or gluten, these pancakes are fragile. The secret is the **Nut Butter Binder**: the fats in the almond or peanut butter help the eggs hold the banana fibers together. Cook these smaller than traditional pancakes—about 3 inches wide—to make them easier to flip without breaking.

## Directions

1.  **Mash:** In a medium bowl, mash the banana until almost liquid.
2.  **Mix:** Whisk in the eggs, oats, nut butter, cinnamon, and salt until a cohesive batter forms.
3.  **Heat:** Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add a tiny amount of butter or oil.
4.  **Sear:** Drop 3-inch circles of batter into the pan. **Do not move them** for 3 minutes until the edges are set and bubbles appear.
5.  **Flip:** Carefully flip and cook for only 60 seconds on the other side.
6.  **Serve:** Serve hot with fresh fruit and a drizzle of maple syrup.
