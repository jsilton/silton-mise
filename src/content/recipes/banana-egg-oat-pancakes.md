## Directions

1. Mash the banana with a fork. Whisk in the eggs, oats, salt and cinnamon until smooth. Add the peanut butter and swirl into the batter.
2. Heat a tablespoon or so of coconut oil/butter in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook for about 2 minutes, until set. You’ll want to make sure the heat isn’t too high so they don’t burn. (Add a few chocolate chips if you like!) Cook on the other side for another 30 seconds.
3. Serve with bananas and maple syrup. Enjoy!
