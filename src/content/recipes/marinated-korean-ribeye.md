## Chef's Note

The secret to authentic Bulgogi is the **thickness of the cut**. It should be paper-thin. If you are not buying it pre-sliced from H-Mart, freeze your ribeye for 45 minutes before slicing—this allows you to get those translucent, restaurant-style strips. The grated pear contains an enzyme called calpain that breaks down the meat fibers, making it melt-in-your-mouth tender.

## Directions

1.  **The Meat:** If not pre-marinated, whisk all marinade ingredients in a bowl. Add the thinly sliced ribeye and toss to coat. Let marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight).
2.  **The Pan:** Heat a cast-iron skillet or wok over high heat until smoking. Add a tiny splash of oil.
3.  **The Sear:** Spread the beef in a single layer. Do not crowd the pan (work in batches). Let it sear undisturbed for 1-2 minutes until you get charred, crispy edges.
4.  **Finish:** Flip and cook for 30 more seconds. Remove immediately.
