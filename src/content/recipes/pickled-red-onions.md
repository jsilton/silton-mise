## Chef's Note

Quick-pickled red onions are a staple Mexican condiment that adds brightness, color, and crunch to tacos, enchiladas, and rich dishes. While they're technically edible immediately, a 30-minute rest allows the vinegar to turn the onions vibrant pink and mellow their raw bite.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Place the sliced onions in a wide-mouth glass jar.
2.  **Dissolve:** In a measuring cup, whisk the vinegar, warm water, sugar, and salt until the sugar is dissolved.
3.  **Pour:** Pour the liquid over the onions. Ensure they are completely submerged (press down with a spoon if needed).
4.  **Pickle:** Let sit at room temperature for 30-60 minutes.
5.  **Store:** Store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
