## Chef's Note

Milanese-style breaded cutlets originated in Milan and traditionally use veal, though chicken became the American adaptation. The name comes from the city of Milan, and the dish is closely related to Austrian Wiener Schnitzel, reflecting the historical connection between northern Italy and Austria. In Milan, it's often served 'alla Milanese' with a simple lemon wedge, but in America, piling arugula salad on top became the signature presentation. Pound the chicken very thin - the large, flat surface area is what creates the signature crispy edges.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Place chicken cutlets between sheets of plastic wrap and pound to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
2.  **Station:** Set up three shallow bowls:
    - Bowl 1: Flour.
    - Bowl 2: Beaten eggs.
    - Bowl 3: Panko, Parmesan, oregano, and garlic powder.
3.  **Bread:** Dredge each piece of chicken in flour (shake off excess), then egg, then press firmly into the panko mixture until fully coated.
4.  **Fry:** Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once shimmering, add the chicken. Fry for 3-4 minutes per side until deep golden brown and crispy.
5.  **Drain:** Transfer to a wire rack or paper-towel-lined plate. Season with a tiny pinch of flaky salt immediately.
6.  **Assemble:** Place the hot chicken on a plate. Pile a generous handful of the [Everyday Arugula Salad](/silton-mise/recipes/everyday-arugula-salad) on top. Squeeze a fresh lemon wedge over everything.
