## Chef's Note

Chicken Milanese is the sophisticated older cousin of the chicken nugget. It is defined by its massive surface area and shatteringly crisp crust. The secret is the **Standard Breading Procedure** (Flour -> Egg -> Breadcrumbs) and using **Panko** mixed with Parmesan for maximum crunch and flavor. We always serve this "North End Style," which means piling a fresh, acidic salad directly on top of the piping hot chicken.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Place chicken cutlets between sheets of plastic wrap and pound to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
2.  **Station:** Set up three shallow bowls:
    - Bowl 1: Flour.
    - Bowl 2: Beaten eggs.
    - Bowl 3: Panko, Parmesan, oregano, and garlic powder.
3.  **Bread:** Dredge each piece of chicken in flour (shake off excess), then egg, then press firmly into the panko mixture until fully coated.
4.  **Fry:** Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once shimmering, add the chicken. Fry for 3-4 minutes per side until deep golden brown and crispy.
5.  **Drain:** Transfer to a wire rack or paper-towel-lined plate. Season with a tiny pinch of flaky salt immediately.
6.  **Assemble:** Place the hot chicken on a plate. Pile a generous handful of the [Everyday Arugula Salad](/silton-mise/recipes/everyday-arugula-salad) on top. Squeeze a fresh lemon wedge over everything.
