## Directions

1. FOR THE FILLING:
2. Mix everything (except the bamboo) together; whip in one direction for a few minutes until the mixture starts to look sticky. Now add the chopped bamboo shoots, and mix everything together. Cover and refrigerate while preparing the dough.
3. FOR THE DOUGH:
4. Mix the wheat starch and cornstarch in a mixing bowl. Slowly add in the boiling water, while stirring rapidly. Now add in the lard (or oil) and continue to stir. Knead the dough for a couple of minutes, until it turns into a smooth dough ball. Roll the dough into a long cylinder, and divide it into 18 equal pieces. Cover the dough pieces with a damp paper towel.
5. TO ASSEMBLE AND COOK THE DUMPLINGS:
6. Turn on the stove to pre-boil the water in the steamer. Take one piece of dough and roll it into a 3” diameter circle. Add a spoonful of filling and fold the dumpling as shown in our video. Continue assembling until all the dumplings are made.
7. Once the water in the steamer is boiled, steam the shrimp dumplings for 6 minutes using high heat and serve hot. Make sure that they each have an inch and a half to expand during the cooking process.
