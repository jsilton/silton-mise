## Chef's Note

Har Gow is the "Black Belt" of Dim Sum. The secret to the legendary **Translucency** is **Culinary Technique** through the **Wheat-Starch Method**. You must use boiling water to gelatinize the starch instantly, creating a dough that is flexible but transforms into a glass-like shell when steamed. For the interior, we use **The Shrimp Bounce Method**: whip the shrimp mixture in one direction until it becomes a sticky paste—this creates the Crunch that differentiates a Kitchen Standard dumpling from a soggy one.

## Directions

1.  **The Filling:** Finely chop the shrimp. In a large bowl, combine shrimp and all shrimp paste ingredients. Whip **vigorously in one direction** for 3 minutes until the mixture is very sticky. Fold in bamboo shoots. Chill for 30 minutes.
2.  **The Dough:** In a heatproof bowl, whisk wheat starch and cornstarch. Pour in the **boiling water** while stirring rapidly with chopsticks. Add lard/oil.
3.  **Knead:** Once cool enough to touch, knead for 2 minutes until smooth. Roll into a cylinder and divide into 18 pieces. Keep covered with a damp towel.
4.  **Shape:** Use a flat blade (lightly oiled) to flatten each dough ball into a thin 3-inch circle.
5.  **Assemble:** Place 1 tbsp filling in the center. Fold and pleat carefully (aim for 7-10 pleats) to create the signature "bonnet" shape.
6.  **Steam:** Place in a bamboo steamer on parchment. Steam over boiling water for exactly 6 minutes on high heat.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with chili oil and soy sauce for the mandatory **High Note**.
