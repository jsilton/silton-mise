## Chef's Note

This is a masterclass in **Culinary Technique** and flavor concentration. The secret to its Success is **The Red Pepper Emulsion Method**: we puree roasted red peppers into the clam-steaming liquid to create a thick, vibrant Texture that standard clam sauces lack. We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Staged Braise**: we wilt the greens in the garlic-chili oil _before_ combining them with the pasta and clams. The mandatory **Acid Balance** comes from mounting the sauce with cold butter and fresh lemon at the very end.

## Directions

1.  **Steaming:** In a large pot, heat 1/4 cup oil. Sauté half the garlic for 1 minute. Add clams and wine. Cover and boil for 5-7 minutes until clams open.
2.  **The Puree:** Transfer opened clams to a plate. Strain the liquid into a blender. Add roasted peppers and pulse until smooth.
3.  **The Greens:** Wipe the pot. Heat 1/4 cup oil. Sauté remaining garlic and chili flakes. Add the chard in batches; sauté for 3 minutes until wilted.
4.  **Boil:** Cook spaghetti until **very al dente**.
5.  **Bind:** Pour the pepper broth into the greens. Add the hot pasta and the cold butter.
6.  **Emulsify:** Toss vigorously over medium heat. Add lemon juice, zest, and Parmesan. Stir until the sauce is glossy.
7.  **Serve:** Return clams to the pot to warm through. Serve in shallow bowls with plenty of extra Parmesan.
