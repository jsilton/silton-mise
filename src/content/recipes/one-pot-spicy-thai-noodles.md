## Chef's Note

This is a high-speed "Fuel" meal that relies on **The Starch Bind Pattern**. The secret to Success is building the entire dish in the pasta pot; we use the residual heat of the cooked noodles to emulsify the **Sriracha-Ginger Glaze** without needing additional fat. We maintain **Texture Integrity** by scrambling the eggs separately first—this ensures they provide a distinct, yellow "Bounce" in every bite rather than turning the sauce into a muddy film. The fresh lime and cilantro provide the mandatory aromatic **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in a large pot of salted water according to package directions. Drain and set aside.
2.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, brown sugar, Sriracha, and grated ginger until smooth.
3.  **The Eggs:** In the same large pot, heat 1 tbsp oil. Scramble the eggs with a pinch of red pepper flakes until just set. Remove and set aside with the pasta.
4.  **The Veg:** Add remaining oil to the pot. Sauté zucchini, mushrooms, and carrots for 5 minutes over high heat until tender-crisp.
5.  **Bind:** Turn heat to low. Return the pasta and eggs to the pot. Pour the sauce over everything.
6.  **Toss:** Toss vigorously for 1 minute until the noodles are glossy and the sauce has thickened.
7.  **Serve:** Remove from heat. Stir in the green onions, cilantro, and crushed peanuts. Serve hot or cold for the Gold Standard experience.
