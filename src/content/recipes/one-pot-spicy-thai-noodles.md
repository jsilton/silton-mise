## Chef's Note

This Thai-inspired one-pot noodle dish builds the sauce directly in the pasta pot, using residual heat to emulsify the sriracha-ginger glaze without extra fat. Scrambling eggs separately first keeps them distinct with bright yellow texture rather than forming a coating. Fresh cilantro and lime add brightness.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in a large pot of salted water according to package directions. Drain and set aside.
2.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, brown sugar, Sriracha, and grated ginger until smooth.
3.  **The Eggs:** In the same large pot, heat 1 tbsp oil. Scramble the eggs with a pinch of red pepper flakes until just set. Remove and set aside with the pasta.
4.  **The Veg:** Add remaining oil to the pot. Sauté zucchini, mushrooms, and carrots for 5 minutes over high heat until tender-crisp.
5.  **Bind:** Turn heat to low. Return the pasta and eggs to the pot. Pour the sauce over everything.
6.  **Toss:** Toss vigorously for 1 minute until the noodles are glossy and the sauce has thickened.
7.  **Serve:** Remove from heat. Stir in the green onions, cilantro, and crushed peanuts. Serve hot or cold for the Kitchen Standard experience.
