## Chef's Note

These are pumpkin cookies with a cream cheese center. The critical step is freezing the cream cheese dollops for at least 45 minutes before wrapping them in the pumpkin dough. This ensures the cheesecake remains a distinct, creamy center rather than melting into the cookie during baking. We chill the dough for 1 hour to ensure it holds its shape around the core. The ginger-sugar coating provides satisfying crunch.

## Directions

1.  **Cheesecake Core:** In a mixer, beat cream cheese, 1/4 cup sugar, and vanilla until smooth. Scoop 12 dollops onto a plate and **freeze for 45 minutes** until firm.
2.  **The Dough:** Cream butter and both sugars for 1 minute. Mix in the pumpkin puree. Gradually add the flour, spices, and salt until **just combined**.
3.  **The Chill:** Roll dough into 12 large balls. Refrigerate for **at least 1 hour** (mandatory for structure).
4.  **Assemble:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Flatten a cold dough ball in your palm. Place a frozen cheesecake dollop in the center. Wrap the dough around the cheese, pinching to seal completely.
5.  **The Crunch:** Roll the stuffed balls in the cinnamon-ginger sugar until heavily coated.
6.  **Bake:** Arrange 3 inches apart on a parchment-lined sheet. Press down lightly to flatten. Bake for 16-19 minutes until the edges are set. **Do not over-bake.**
7.  **Cool:** Let cool on the pan for 10 minutes. These are elite when refrigerated and eaten cold.
