## Chef's Note
This salad is a study in **Texture Integrity** through **The Roasted Stacks Pattern**. The secret to its Success is **The Massage Pattern**: you must rub the kale with sea salt for 2 minutes *before* adding the hot vegetables; this breaks down the tough cellulose for a tender "Bounce." We maintain the "Snap" by roasting the sweet potatoes and sprouts at 375°F until charred. The maple-mustard emulsion provides the mandatory **Acid Finish** that bridges the sweet stone fruit and earthy greens.

## Directions

1.  **Roast:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Toss sweet potatoes, sprouts, and onion with 2 tbsp oil, salt, and pepper. Roast for 20-25 minutes until caramelized and tender.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a small jar, whisk together the 1/3 cup oil, vinegar, syrup, Dijon, and garlic until thick and opaque.
3.  **Massage:** Place chopped kale in a large bowl. Sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt. **Massage for 2 minutes** until soft and dark green.
4.  **Assemble:** Add the warm roasted vegetables directly to the kale bowl. 
5.  **Bind:** Add the cranberries and Parmesan. Pour the dressing over the top.
6.  **Toss:** Toss vigorously with your hands until every leaf is coated in the sweet-savory emulsion. Serve immediately.
