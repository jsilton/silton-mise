## Chef's Note

This salad combines roasted and raw vegetables for contrasting textures. The secret is massaging the kale with sea salt for 2 minutes before adding the hot vegetables. This breaks down the tough cellulose for a tender texture. Roasting the sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts at 375°F until charred provides crispy contrast. The maple-mustard emulsion provides essential acidity that bridges the sweet vegetables and earthy greens.

## Directions

1.  **Roast:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Toss sweet potatoes, sprouts, and onion with 2 tbsp oil, salt, and pepper. Roast for 20-25 minutes until caramelized and tender.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a small jar, whisk together the 1/3 cup oil, vinegar, syrup, Dijon, and garlic until thick and opaque.
3.  **Massage:** Place chopped kale in a large bowl. Sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt. **Massage for 2 minutes** until soft and dark green.
4.  **Assemble:** Add the warm roasted vegetables directly to the kale bowl.
5.  **Bind:** Add the cranberries and Parmesan. Pour the dressing over the top.
6.  **Toss:** Toss vigorously with your hands until every leaf is coated in the sweet-savory emulsion. Serve immediately.
