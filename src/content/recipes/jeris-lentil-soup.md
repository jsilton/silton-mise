## Notes

Dear Kristen and Jordan,Since your wedding has a theatrical theme, I wanted to share something that has sustained my career: soup. Not only is soup nutritious and quick, but it can be made in great quantities and frozen. My notes below will testify that this recipe is one (of a dozen or so) that I have relied on to get me through intense periods of evening rehearsals and performances.Additionally this recipe has a Broadway heritage. Jeri is my friend who was a Broadway and Off-Broadway dancer for many years; she started with the original production of West Side Story. When she married, Chits Rivera was in her wedding party. When Jeri reached her forties, her body dictated that she give up her dancing shoes, so she became a licensed nutritionist. Therefore, of the soup recipes I use, this one seemed the most appropriate for a theatrical sendoff of your life together.Enjoy. We give his with our strongest wishes for much happiness in your future.Pat Miller and Sean Kilpatrick
