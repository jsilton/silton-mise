## Chef's Note

This traditional recipe was a wedding gift from Pat Miller and Sean Kilpatrick, passed down from Jeri, a Broadway dancer turned nutritionist. Adding sherry vinegar at the end brightens earthy lentils—the acidity wakes up the palate. For creamier texture without dairy, pulse with an immersion blender a few times before serving, releasing lentil starch while keeping the carrot slices intact.

## Directions

1.  **Sauté:** Heat oil in a large skillet. Sauté onions and carrots with the Italian seasoning for 5-8 minutes until translucent.
2.  **The Pot:** Transfer the vegetables to a slow cooker. Add the lentils, crushed tomatoes, and broth.
3.  **Slow Cook:** Cook on **LOW** for 5 hours (or on high for 3 hours) until lentils are tender but not mushy.
4.  **Infuse:** Stir in the white wine and parsley. Cook for another 30 minutes.
5.  **Texture (Optional):** Use an immersion blender to pulse the soup a few times to create a thicker body.
6.  **The Acid Balance:** Stir in the sherry vinegar or lemon juice. Season generously with salt and black pepper.
