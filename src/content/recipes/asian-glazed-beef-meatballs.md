## Chef's Note

These meatballs bridge Chinese and American flavors - the hoisin and Peking duck sauce glaze is authentic to Chinese-American restaurant cuisine, while the meatball technique comes from Italian-American cooking. Peking duck sauce, originally created for Beijing's famous lacquered duck, became a Chinese-American pantry staple in the 1970s. It's sweeter and more complex than standard hoisin, with hints of five-spice and fruit. The key to a great glaze is reducing it until it's thick enough to cling to the meatballs - if it's too thin, it will just run off.

## Directions

1.  **Make the Meatballs:** In a large bowl, combine ground beef, panko, egg, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, green onions, pepper, and salt. Mix gently with your hands just until combined - don't overmix or the meatballs will be tough. Roll into 24 meatballs (about 1.5 inches each, roughly 1 oz each).

2.  **Bake the Meatballs:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange meatballs on the sheet with space between them. Bake for 15-18 minutes until browned and cooked through (internal temp 160°F).

3.  **Make the Glaze:** While meatballs bake, whisk together hoisin sauce, duck sauce, rice vinegar, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, and water in a small bowl.

4.  **Sear for Color (Optional but Recommended):** Heat 1 tsp vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the baked meatballs and sear for 2-3 minutes, tossing occasionally, until they develop a nice caramelized crust.

5.  **Glaze the Meatballs:** Pour the glaze over the meatballs in the skillet. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 5-7 minutes, tossing frequently, until the sauce reduces to a thick, sticky glaze that coats the meatballs. If the sauce gets too thick, add a splash of water.

6.  **Serve:** Transfer glazed meatballs to a serving plate. Garnish with sesame seeds and sliced scallions. Serve over coconut jasmine rice or regular steamed rice with your choice of vegetables.

## Quick Hack

For a 20-minute version, use 1.5 lbs frozen beef meatballs (about 24 count). Skip steps 1-2. Heat 1 tsp oil in a large skillet over medium-high and add frozen meatballs. Sauté for 8-10 minutes, tossing frequently, until charred and heated through. Continue with step 5 to glaze.
