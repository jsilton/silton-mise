## Chef's Note

Full-fat Greek yogurt's lactic acid gently breaks down chicken's muscle fibers, while lemon juice provides additional tenderizing enzymes—a double-action marinade that oil-based versions can't match. A pinch of cinnamon bridges smoky paprika and bright citrus, a common Middle Eastern seasoning approach. Marinate at least 8 hours for proper texture.

## Directions

1.  **The Marinade:** In a large bowl, whisk together the yogurt, oil, lemon juice, zest, garlic, and all spices.
2.  **The Soak:** Toss the chicken pieces in the yogurt mixture until heavily coated. **Refrigerate for at least 8 hours** (ideally overnight).
3.  **Skewer:** Thread the chicken onto metal skewers, alternating with red onion chunks. Do not crowd the skewers—ensure there is space for the heat to circulate.
4.  **The Sear:** Preheat a grill to medium-high. Lightly oil the grates.
5.  **Cook:** Grill kabobs for 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally. The yogurt will create a charred, crispy crust. The internal temp should reach 165°F.
6.  **Rest:** Transfer to a platter and **rest for 5 minutes** before serving.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with fresh parsley and extra lemon wedges.
