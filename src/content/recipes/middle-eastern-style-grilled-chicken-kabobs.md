## Chef's Note

The secret to "Restaurant Quality" kabobs is **Structural Science** through **The Yogurt Tenderizer Pattern**. The lactic acid in full-fat Greek yogurt gently breaks down the chicken's muscle fibers, while the lemon juice provides a secondary **Enzyme Tenderizer**. This results in a "Bounce" that is unattainable with oil-based marinades. We use a pinch of **Cinnamon** as the "Deep Note"—it bridges the gap between the smoky paprika and the bright citrus. You must marinate for at least 8 hours to achieve the Gold Standard texture.

## Directions

1.  **The Marinade:** In a large bowl, whisk together the yogurt, oil, lemon juice, zest, garlic, and all spices.
2.  **The Soak:** Toss the chicken pieces in the yogurt mixture until heavily coated. **Refrigerate for at least 8 hours** (ideally overnight).
3.  **Skewer:** Thread the chicken onto metal skewers, alternating with red onion chunks. Do not crowd the skewers—ensure there is space for the heat to circulate.
4.  **The Sear:** Preheat a grill to medium-high. Lightly oil the grates.
5.  **Cook:** Grill kabobs for 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally. The yogurt will create a charred, "Snappy" crust. The internal temp should reach 165°F.
6.  **Rest:** Transfer to a platter and **rest for 5 minutes** before serving.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with fresh parsley and extra lemon wedges.
