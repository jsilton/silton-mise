## Chef's Note

This is a high-protein, nutritious focused take on Enchiladas Suizas. By adding **White Beans** to the shredded chicken filling, we increase the fiber and satiety of the dish. The secret to the sauce is blending the green chiles and cilantro directly into the sour cream—this creates a vibrant, tangy, and creamy "Suiza" glaze that is lighter than traditional versions but hits the same flavor notes.

## Directions

1.  **The Filling:** In a bowl, toss the shredded chicken, beans, cumin, and 1/4 cup of the green sauce.
2.  **The Sauce:** In a blender, combine the enchilada sauce, diced green chiles, cilantro, and sour cream. Pulse until smooth and creamy.
3.  **Assemble:** Spread 1/2 cup of sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 dish. Fill each tortilla with the chicken/bean mixture, roll tightly, and place seam-side down.
4.  **Bake:** Pour the remaining sauce over the top. Cover with cheese.
5.  **Crisp:** Bake at 375°F for 20-25 minutes until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese is golden.
6.  **Finish:** Top with fresh cilantro and [quick Pickled Red Onions](/silton-mise/recipes/pickled-red-onions).
