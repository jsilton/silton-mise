## Chef's Note

Enchiladas Suizas (Swiss-style enchiladas) originated in Mexico City in the 1950s at Sanborns restaurant, named for their creamy, dairy-rich green tomatillo sauce. This version adds white beans to the chicken filling for extra protein and fiber. Blending green chiles and cilantro directly into sour cream creates a lighter, tangy version of the traditional cream-based sauce.

## Directions

1.  **The Filling:** In a bowl, toss the shredded chicken, beans, cumin, and 1/4 cup of the green sauce.
2.  **The Sauce:** In a blender, combine the enchilada sauce, diced green chiles, cilantro, and sour cream. Pulse until smooth and creamy.
3.  **Assemble:** Spread 1/2 cup of sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 dish. Fill each tortilla with the chicken/bean mixture, roll tightly, and place seam-side down.
4.  **Bake:** Pour the remaining sauce over the top. Cover with cheese.
5.  **Crisp:** Bake at 375°F for 20-25 minutes until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese is golden.
6.  **Finish:** Top with fresh cilantro and [quick Pickled Red Onions](/mise/recipes/pickled-red-onions).
