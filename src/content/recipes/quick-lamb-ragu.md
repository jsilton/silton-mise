## Chef's Note

Lamb ragù is popular in Central and Southern Italy, especially in regions like Abruzzo, Molise, and Lazio where sheep farming is traditional. Unlike beef or pork ragù, lamb has a distinctive gamey richness that pairs beautifully with tomatoes and aromatic herbs like oregano and rosemary. The anchovy trick is genius - it "melts" into the oil and adds umami depth without making the dish taste fishy. This is a common Italian technique (see: puttanesca, bagna cauda). Balsamic vinegar at the end brightens the sauce and cuts through the lamb's fat. Brown the meat well to develop flavor - you want crispy bits, not boiled gray meat.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a large heavy pot, heat 2 tbsp oil. Sauté onion and garlic for 5-8 minutes until soft. Stir in the red pepper flakes and anchovies; cook for 2 minutes until the fish "melts" into the oil.
2.  **The Bloom:** Add the tomato paste. Sauté for 3 minutes until dark and fragrant.
3.  **The Sear:** Add the ground lamb. Increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring frequently, for 8 minutes until the meat is browned and starting to crisp.
4.  **Simmer:** Pour in the crushed tomatoes and 1/2 cup water. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 25-30 minutes until the sauce is thick and meaty.
5.  **Boil:** While sauce simmers, cook pasta until **very al dente**.
6.  **Finish:** Stir the balsamic vinegar and fresh herbs into the sauce. Toss with the hot pasta.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with a "High Note" pat of Parmesan or Pecorino.
