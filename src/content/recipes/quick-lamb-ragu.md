## Chef's Note

The secret to a 45-minute ragù that tastes like a 4-hour braise is **Culinary Technique** through **The Anchovy Pulse Method**. By melting two anchovy fillets into the onion base, we introduce a deep, savory foundation that amplifies the earthiness of the lamb. We maintain **Textural Balance** by frying the lamb until it "sizzles in its own fat"—this ensures a Crunch to the meat rather than a boiled texture. The balsamic vinegar provides the mandatory **Acid Balance** to cut through the rich lamb fat.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a large heavy pot, heat 2 tbsp oil. Sauté onion and garlic for 5-8 minutes until soft. Stir in the red pepper flakes and anchovies; cook for 2 minutes until the fish "melts" into the oil.
2.  **The Bloom:** Add the tomato paste. Sauté for 3 minutes until dark and fragrant.
3.  **The Sear:** Add the ground lamb. Increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring frequently, for 8 minutes until the meat is browned and starting to crisp.
4.  **Simmer:** Pour in the crushed tomatoes and 1/2 cup water. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 25-30 minutes until the sauce is thick and meaty.
5.  **Boil:** While sauce simmers, cook pasta until **very al dente**.
6.  **Finish:** Stir the balsamic vinegar and fresh herbs into the sauce. Toss with the hot pasta.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with a "High Note" pat of Parmesan or Pecorino.
