## Chef's Note
The secret to these 25-minute potatoes is **Texture Integrity** through the **Glaze Pattern**. Instead of boiling or steaming, we roast the rounds at high heat (400°F) in a honey-butter emulsion. The **Lime Juice** provides the mandatory **Acid Finish**, which prevents the dish from being cloyingly sweet and ensures the cinnamon notes are bright rather than muddy. Ensure the slices are uniform in thickness to guarantee even cooking.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Spray a rimmed baking sheet generously with oil spray.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a large bowl, whisk together melted butter, honey, lime juice, and cinnamon until smooth.
3.  **Toss:** Add the sweet potato rounds to the bowl and toss until every slice is fully coated in the glaze.
4.  **Arrange:** Place the slices in a **single layer** on the baking sheet (do not overlap, or they will steam instead of roast). Season with salt and black pepper.
5.  **Roast:** Bake for 20-25 minutes until tender and the edges are slightly caramelized. Serve hot.
