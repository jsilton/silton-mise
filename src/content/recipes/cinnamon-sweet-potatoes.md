## Chef's Note

The key to these 25-minute potatoes is roasting the rounds at high heat (400°F) in a honey-butter mixture instead of boiling or steaming. The lime juice prevents the dish from being cloyingly sweet and ensures the cinnamon notes stay bright rather than muddy. Ensure the slices are uniform in thickness to guarantee even cooking.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Spray a rimmed baking sheet generously with oil spray.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a large bowl, whisk together melted butter, honey, lime juice, and cinnamon until smooth.
3.  **Toss:** Add the sweet potato rounds to the bowl and toss until every slice is fully coated in the glaze.
4.  **Arrange:** Place the slices in a **single layer** on the baking sheet (do not overlap, or they will steam instead of roast). Season with salt and black pepper.
5.  **Roast:** Bake for 20-25 minutes until tender and the edges are slightly caramelized. Serve hot.
