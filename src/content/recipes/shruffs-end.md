A sophisticated spirit-forward cocktail that beautifully balances the peaty smoke of Islay Scotch with the apple sweetness of brandy, rounded out with herbal complexity from Bénédictine and a touch of anise from Peychaud's bitters.

## Ingredients

- 1 oz Laphroaig 10-Year Islay Single-Malt Scotch
- 1 oz Laird's 100 Proof Straight Apple Brandy
- 0.5 oz Bénédictine
- 2 dashes Peychaud's bitters
- Ice for stirring
- Orange peel or lemon peel for garnish (optional)

## Directions

1. Add the Laphroaig Scotch, apple brandy, Bénédictine, and Peychaud's bitters to a mixing glass filled with ice.

2. Stir well for 20-30 seconds until properly chilled and diluted.

3. Strain into a chilled coupe or rocks glass over a large ice cube (if serving on the rocks).

4. Express an orange or lemon peel over the drink and garnish if desired.

5. Serve immediately and enjoy the complex interplay of smoke, fruit, and herbal notes.

## Chef's Note

This is a bold, complex cocktail that showcases the unique character of peated Scotch. The Laird's apple brandy provides a fruity backbone that tames the smoke, while Bénédictine adds honeyed herbal complexity. Peychaud's bitters contribute a subtle anise note that ties everything together. Best enjoyed slowly to appreciate the evolving flavors as the ice melts slightly.
