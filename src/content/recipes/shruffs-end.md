A sophisticated spirit-forward cocktail that beautifully balances the peaty smoke of Islay Scotch with the apple sweetness of brandy, rounded out with herbal complexity from Bénédictine and a touch of anise from Peychaud's bitters.

## Ingredients

- 1 oz Laphroaig 10-Year Islay Single-Malt Scotch
- 1 oz Laird's 100 Proof Straight Apple Brandy
- 0.5 oz Bénédictine
- 2 dashes Peychaud's bitters
- Ice for stirring
- Orange peel or lemon peel for garnish (optional)

## Directions

1. Add the Laphroaig Scotch, apple brandy, Bénédictine, and Peychaud's bitters to a mixing glass filled with ice.

2. Stir well for 20-30 seconds until properly chilled and diluted.

3. Strain into a chilled coupe or rocks glass over a large ice cube (if serving on the rocks).

4. Express an orange or lemon peel over the drink and garnish if desired.

5. Serve immediately and enjoy the complex interplay of smoke, fruit, and herbal notes.

## Chef's Note

Shruff's End comes from the modern craft cocktail movement, representing the bold, spirit-forward style popularized by bars like Death & Co in New York. The name likely references Shruff House from the Harry Potter series, fitting for a drink that combines magic-like alchemy. It's part of a wave of cocktails that pair smoky Islay Scotch with American spirits, creating something uniquely contemporary. The Laphroaig's medicinal peat smoke is tamed by the apple sweetness of Laird's brandy, while Bénédictine adds honeyed herbal notes that bridge the two.
