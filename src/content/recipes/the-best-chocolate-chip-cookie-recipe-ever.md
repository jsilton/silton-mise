## Chef's Note

This is a quick chocolate chip cookie recipe. The key is removing the cookies from the oven when the edges are barely golden but the centers still look wet and underdone. The residual heat on the baking pan will finish the cooking in about 2 minutes, resulting in a cookie with a crisp edge and soft, gooey center. We use a full 3 cups of flour to provide the structure needed to hold the massive amount of chocolate.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
2.  **Cream:** In a stand mixer, beat softened butter and both sugars for 2 minutes until light and fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla; beat until emulsified.
3.  **Incorporate:** Gradually add the dry mix until **just combined**. Fold in the chocolate chips.
4.  **Shape:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Line sheets with parchment. Roll 2-tbsp balls of dough and place 2 inches apart.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 8-10 minutes. **Pull them early**—the Kitchen Standard is a pale, soft center.
6.  **The Finish:** Let rest on the hot pan for exactly 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.
