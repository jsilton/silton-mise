## Chef's Note
This is the definitive "Speed" dessert for the Silton Standard. The secret to Success is **The Under-Bake Pattern**: you must remove the cookies from the oven when the edges are barely golden but the centers still look "wet" and underdone. The residual heat on the baking pan (The 2-Minute Set) will finish the cook, resulting in a cookie with a permanent "Bounce" and soft, gooey center. We maintain **Texture Integrity** by using a full 3 cups of flour to provide the structural "Snap" needed to hold the massive amount of chocolate.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. 
2.  **Cream:** In a stand mixer, beat softened butter and both sugars for 2 minutes until light and fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla; beat until emulsified.
3.  **Incorporate:** Gradually add the dry mix until **just combined**. Fold in the chocolate chips.
4.  **Shape:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Line sheets with parchment. Roll 2-tbsp balls of dough and place 2 inches apart.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 8-10 minutes. **Pull them early**—the Gold Standard is a pale, soft center.
6.  **The Set:** Let rest on the hot pan for exactly 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.
