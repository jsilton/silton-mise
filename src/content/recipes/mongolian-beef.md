## Chef's Note

Mongolian Beef is not a stew; it is a **Dry Sear**. To achieve the restaurant-quality "crispy" edges, we coat the beef in cornstarch and sear it at extreme heat until it develops a crust. We then toss it in a ginger-heavy glaze that should be thick enough to coat the meat, not pool in the bottom of the bowl. This is the **Culinary Technique** of velveting in action.

## Directions

1.  **Velvet:** Toss the steak slices with cornstarch until every piece is coated. Let sit for 10 minutes.
2.  **The Glaze:** In a small saucepan, whisk the soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger, and garlic. Simmer for 5 minutes until syrupy. Set aside.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat 1/4 cup oil in a wok or large heavy skillet over high heat until smoking.
4.  **Crisp:** Add the beef in a single layer (work in batches!). Sear for 2 minutes per side until the edges are dark brown and crispy. Remove to a plate and drain excess oil.
5.  **Finish:** Wipe out the pan. Return the beef to the wok. Pour in the ginger glaze and add the green onions.
6.  **Toss:** Toss vigorously over high heat for 30-60 seconds until the sauce bubbles and lacquers the beef.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately over [Jasmine Rice](/silton-mise/recipes/homemade-rice-pilaf).
