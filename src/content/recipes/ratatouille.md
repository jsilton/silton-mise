## Chef's Note

Ratatouille comes from Nice in Provence, France, where it's been made since the 18th century as a way to use up summer vegetables. The name comes from the French 'touiller,' meaning to stir or toss food. The Pixar movie made it famous worldwide, though that version shows a tian (sliced vegetables baked in a dish) rather than traditional ratatouille which is more of a rustic stew. The key is cooking each vegetable separately first - eggplant, peppers, and zucchini all have different cooking times and water contents. Roasting at high heat rather than stewing prevents the vegetables from becoming mushy and develops caramelized flavor.

## Directions

1.  **Stage 1 (Roast):** Preheat oven to 425°F. On one sheet pan, toss eggplant with 2 tbsp oil and salt. On another, toss peppers, zucchini, and squash with 1 tbsp oil and salt. Roast for 15-20 minutes until caramelized and tender.
2.  **The Base:** In a large Dutch oven, sauté onion in 2 tbsp oil for 10 minutes until golden. Add garlic for 30 seconds.
3.  **The Sauce:** Stir in the grated tomato pulp. Simmer over medium-low for 15 minutes to reduce the liquid.
4.  **Combine:** Carefully fold the roasted eggplant, peppers, and squash into the tomato sauce. Simmer for 5 minutes to let the flavors meld.
5.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Stir in the fresh basil, red pepper flakes, and a squeeze of lemon for the mandatory **Acid Balance**.
6.  **Serve:** Serve hot or at room temperature with a final drizzle of high-quality olive oil.
