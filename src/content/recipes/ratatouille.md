## Chef's Note
Traditional ratatouille is often a mushy stew; we elevate it to the Silton Standard through **Texture Integrity** and **The Roasted Pattern**. Instead of simmering everything together, we roast the eggplant and peppers at high heat (425°F) separately. This ensures each vegetable maintains its "Snap" and color. We use **The Pulp Pattern** for the sauce: grating the fresh tomatoes removes the skins and creates a frothy, fresh base that binds the roasted components into a vibrant "Bounce."

## Directions

1.  **Stage 1 (Roast):** Preheat oven to 425°F. On one sheet pan, toss eggplant with 2 tbsp oil and salt. On another, toss peppers, zucchini, and squash with 1 tbsp oil and salt. Roast for 15-20 minutes until caramelized and tender.
2.  **The Base:** In a large Dutch oven, sauté onion in 2 tbsp oil for 10 minutes until golden. Add garlic for 30 seconds.
3.  **The Sauce:** Stir in the grated tomato pulp. Simmer over medium-low for 15 minutes to reduce the liquid.
4.  **Combine:** Carefully fold the roasted eggplant, peppers, and squash into the tomato sauce. Simmer for 5 minutes to let the flavors meld.
5.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Stir in the fresh basil, red pepper flakes, and a squeeze of lemon for the mandatory **Acid Finish**.
6.  **Serve:** Serve hot or at room temperature with a final drizzle of high-quality olive oil.
