## Chef's Note

The secret to a great Keema is **Deep Browning**. You must sear the ground lamb until it develops a dark, savory crust before adding the aromatics. The peas provide a sweet "pop" that balances the richness of the lamb. We finish with a heavy hit of lemon juice and fresh cilantro to provide the **Acid Finish** that keeps this dish from feeling heavy.

## Directions

1.  **Sear:** Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add the lamb and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until deeply browned and slightly crispy.
2.  **Aromatics:** Add the diced onion to the lamb fat. Cook for 5 minutes until soft. Stir in the ginger and garlic.
3.  **Bloom:** Add the cumin seeds, turmeric, chili, and tomato paste. Stir constantly for 1 minute until fragrant.
4.  **Simmer:** Add a splash of water (about 1/4 cup) to keep it saucy. Stir in the frozen peas. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes.
5.  **Finish:** Stir in the Garam Masala, lemon juice, and cilantro.
6.  **Serve:** Serve with warm Naan or over rice.
