## Chef's Note

A great pot pie is defined by the velouté (the gravy) and the flaky crust. This version uses poached or roasted chicken chunks rather than boiled chicken to preserve the meaty texture. The secret is celery seed: it provides that savory depth that makes the pie taste like a professional bakery version. For the best result, use the Vodka Hack dough from our Apple Pie recipe.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 425°F.
2.  **The Gravy (The Roux):** In a large saucepan, melt butter. Sauté onions and celery until soft (5 mins). Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute.
3.  **Emulsify:** Gradually whisk in the broth and milk. Simmer until the sauce is thick and glossy. Stir in the garlic powder, celery seed, salt, and pepper.
4.  **Mix:** Fold in the cooked chicken, carrots, and peas.
5.  **Assemble:** Line a 9-inch pie pan with the bottom crust. Pour in the filling. Top with the second crust. Seal and flute the edges.
6.  **The Wash:** Cut 4 steam vents in the top. Brush with a beaten egg.
7.  **Bake:** Bake for 30-35 minutes until the pastry is deep golden brown and the filling is bubbling.
8.  **Rest:** Let sit for 10 minutes before serving. This allows the gravy to set so it doesn't run.
