## Chef's Note

A great pot pie is defined by the **Velouté** (the gravy) and the **Flaky Crust**. We have moved away from the "boiled chicken" version; instead, use poached or roasted chicken chunks to preserve the meaty texture. The secret to the Kitchen Standard is the **Celery Seed**: it provides that "savory soul" that makes the pie taste like a professional bakery version. For the best result, use the Vodka Hack dough from our Apple Pie recipe.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 425°F.
2.  **The Gravy (The Roux):** In a large saucepan, melt butter. Sauté onions and celery until soft (5 mins). Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute.
3.  **Emulsify:** Gradually whisk in the broth and milk. Simmer until the sauce is thick and glossy. Stir in the garlic powder, celery seed, salt, and pepper.
4.  **Mix:** Fold in the cooked chicken, carrots, and peas.
5.  **Assemble:** Line a 9-inch pie pan with the bottom crust. Pour in the filling. Top with the second crust. Seal and flute the edges.
6.  **The Wash:** Cut 4 steam vents in the top. Brush with a beaten egg.
7.  **Bake:** Bake for 30-35 minutes until the pastry is deep golden brown and the filling is bubbling.
8.  **Rest:** Let sit for 10 minutes before serving. This allows the gravy to set so it doesn't run.
