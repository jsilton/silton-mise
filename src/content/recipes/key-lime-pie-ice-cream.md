## Chef's Note

This is a high-speed technical dish dessert that mimics the exact flavor profile of our [Key Lime Pie](/silton-mise/recipes/key-lime-pie). The secret to a professional-grade churn is **Culinary Technique** through **The Condensed Milk Emulsion**: the sugar and fats in the condensed milk act as a powerful stabilizer, preventing the formation of large ice crystals and ensuring a silky "Bounce." We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Graham Snap Method**: we stir half the crackers into the churn and reserve the other half for the topping just before serving—this ensures you have both soft, cake-like bits and shatteringly crisp "Snaps."

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a large bowl, whisk together the condensed milk, key lime juice, 2% milk, cream, and salt until perfectly smooth.
2.  **The Churn:** Pour the mixture into your ice cream maker. Churn according to the manufacturer's instructions (usually 20-25 minutes).
3.  **The Crunch:** During the last 2 minutes of churning, add 1/3 cup of the coarsely crushed graham crackers.
4.  **The Finish:** Transfer the soft-serve consistency ice cream to a chilled, freezer-safe container. Cover and freeze for **at least 4 hours** (ideally overnight) to firm up.
5.  **Serve:** Scoop into bowls. Top with the remaining reserved graham cracker crumbs and a fresh lime wedge for the mandatory **Acid Balance**.
