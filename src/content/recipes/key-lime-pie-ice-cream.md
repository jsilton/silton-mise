## Chef's Note

This frozen dessert mimics the exact flavor profile of our [Key Lime Pie](/mise/recipes/key-lime-pie). The secret to a smooth, professional churn is the condensed milk: the sugar and fats act as a powerful stabilizer, preventing the formation of large ice crystals and ensuring a silky texture. We use a two-part graham cracker approach—stir half into the churn and reserve the other half for topping just before serving. This ensures you have both soft, cake-like bits and shatteringly crisp pieces.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a large bowl, whisk together the condensed milk, key lime juice, 2% milk, cream, and salt until perfectly smooth.
2.  **The Churn:** Pour the mixture into your ice cream maker. Churn according to the manufacturer's instructions (usually 20-25 minutes).
3.  **The Crunch:** During the last 2 minutes of churning, add 1/3 cup of the coarsely crushed graham crackers.
4.  **The Finish:** Transfer the soft-serve consistency ice cream to a chilled, freezer-safe container. Cover and freeze for **at least 4 hours** (ideally overnight) to firm up.
5.  **Serve:** Scoop into bowls. Top with the remaining reserved graham cracker crumbs and a fresh lime wedge for the mandatory **Acid Balance**.
