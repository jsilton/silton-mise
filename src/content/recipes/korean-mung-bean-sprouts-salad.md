## Chef's Note

This is a classic Korean side dish. The key to crisp sprouts is blanching them for exactly 2 minutes and immediately plunging them into ice water. To avoid a watery dressing, gather the chilled sprouts and squeeze with your hands until bone-dry. This ensures the sesame-garlic dressing binds directly to the sprouts, providing a nutty, savory flavor in every bite.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Bring a large pot of water to a boil with 1 tsp salt. Prepare an ice-water bath.
2.  **Blanch:** Rinse sprouts in cold water. Add to boiling water and cook for 1-2 minutes until just translucent but still firm.
3.  **Shock:** Drain immediately and submerge in the ice water for 2 minutes to stop the cooking.
4.  **The Squeeze:** Squeeze the cold sprouts with your hands until **no more liquid drips out**. They should feel like a dense, dry mass.
5.  **Toss:** In a large bowl, whisk the scallion, garlic, salt, and sesame oil. Separate the sprouts and toss vigorously with the dressing and sesame seeds.
6.  **Serve:** Best served chilled or at room temperature.
