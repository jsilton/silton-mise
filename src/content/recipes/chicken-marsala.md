## Chef's Note

This is the definitive version of a restaurant classic. The depth of flavor comes from three critical layers: rendering the fat from the **prosciutto**, browning the mushrooms until they are meaty and concentrated, and using **Dry Marsala** instead of the overly-sweet variety found in grocery stores. We finish the dish by "mounting" cold butter off the heat, which creates a glossy, thick emulsion that clings to the chicken rather than a greasy puddle.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Place the chicken thighs between sheets of plastic wrap and pound with a flat mallet until 1/4-inch thick. This ensures they cook in minutes and stay tender. Season the flour with salt and pepper in a shallow dish.
2.  **Sear:** Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge the chicken in flour, shake off the excess, and sear for 3-4 minutes per side until golden. Work in batches to avoid crowding. Remove chicken to a warm platter.
3.  **The Base:** Reduce heat to medium. Add the prosciutto and sauté for 1 minute to render the fat. Add the mushrooms and cook undisturbed for 3-4 minutes, then stir and cook until deep brown and their liquid has evaporated.
4.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the Dry Marsala. Scrape the bottom of the pan to release the "fond" (browned bits). Boil for 1-2 minutes until the wine has reduced by half.
5.  **Simmer:** Add the chicken stock and simmer for 3 minutes to thicken the sauce slightly.
6.  **The Butter Mount:** Turn off the heat. Add the cold butter cubes and whisk or swirl the pan constantly until the butter is melted and the sauce looks glossy and thick.
7.  **Finish:** Return the chicken to the pan for 1 minute just to warm through. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve immediately.
