## Chef's Note

The secret to elite shrimp and grits is **Textural Balance** through **The Bacon Render Method**. We fry the bacon until shatteringly crisp, then use the rendered fat to flash-sear the shrimp. This ensures the seafood has a smoky, savory Crunch while the grits provide a velvety, creamy "Bounce." We maintain **Culinary Technique** by using stone-ground grits; they require a 25-minute simmer to fully hydrate, resulting in a complex toothsome quality. The lemon juice provides the mandatory **Acid Balance**.

## Directions

1.  **The Grits:** Bring 4 cups water to a boil. Whisk in the grits and salt. Reduce heat to **very low**, cover, and simmer for 20-25 minutes until thick and creamy.
2.  **Emulsify:** Stir in the butter and 2 cups of cheddar cheese until molten. Keep warm.
3.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet, fry the bacon until crispy. Remove bacon to a plate, leaving the fat in the pan.
4.  **The Sear:** Increase heat to medium-high. Add the shrimp to the bacon fat. Sear for 2 minutes until pink.
5.  **Bind:** Add the garlic, scallions, parsley, and lemon juice to the skillet. Toss for 1 minute to create a light, smoky glaze.
6.  **Assemble:** Spoon a generous mound of cheesy grits into 4 bowls. Top with the shrimp and bacon mixture.
7.  **Finish:** Garnish with extra scallions and a "High Note" crack of black pepper.
