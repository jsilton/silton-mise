## Chef's Note

The secret to great shrimp and grits is the contrast between crispy protein and creamy grits. We fry the bacon until shatteringly crisp, then use the rendered fat to flash-sear the shrimp. This ensures the seafood has a smoky, savory crunch while the grits provide a velvety, creamy texture. We use stone-ground grits; they require a 25-minute simmer to fully hydrate, resulting in a complex, toothsome quality. The lemon juice provides the bright acidity needed to balance the rich dish.

## Directions

1.  **The Grits:** Bring 4 cups water to a boil. Whisk in the grits and salt. Reduce heat to **very low**, cover, and simmer for 20-25 minutes until thick and creamy.
2.  **Emulsify:** Stir in the butter and 2 cups of cheddar cheese until molten. Keep warm.
3.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet, fry the bacon until crispy. Remove bacon to a plate, leaving the fat in the pan.
4.  **The Sear:** Increase heat to medium-high. Add the shrimp to the bacon fat. Sear for 2 minutes until pink.
5.  **Bind:** Add the garlic, scallions, parsley, and lemon juice to the skillet. Toss for 1 minute to create a light, smoky glaze.
6.  **Assemble:** Spoon a generous mound of cheesy grits into 4 bowls. Top with the shrimp and bacon mixture.
7.  **Finish:** Garnish with extra scallions and a "High Note" crack of black pepper.
