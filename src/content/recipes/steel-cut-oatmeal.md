## Chef's Note

The secret to "Kitchen Standard" oatmeal is **Culinary Technique** through **The Toasting Method**. You must fry the dry oats in butter for 2 minutes _before_ adding the water; this creates a protective nutty shell that ensures each grain maintains a resilient Crunch rather than turning into a gluey mash. We use **Buttermilk** as the mandatory **Acid Balance**; stirring it in at the very end provides a sophisticated tang that balances the sweet brown sugar and gives the porridge a rich, custardy "Bounce."

## Directions

1.  **The Toast:** In a heavy saucepan, melt the butter. Add the oats and stir constantly for 2-3 minutes until they smell like toasted popcorn and look golden.
2.  **Simmer:** Pour in the boiling water and a pinch of salt. Reduce heat to **very low**. Cover and cook for 25 minutes. **Do not stir.**
3.  **Emulsify:** Open the lid. Add the whole milk and half of the buttermilk. Stir gently for 10 minutes over low heat until the oats are creamy and "squeaky" to the bite (al dente).
4.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Stir in the remaining buttermilk, brown sugar, and cinnamon for the mandatory **High Note**.
5.  **Serve:** Serve hot with fresh berries or a drizzle of maple syrup.
