## Chef's Note

Steel-cut oats (also called Irish or Scottish oats) are whole oat groats cut into pieces rather than rolled flat, giving them a chewy texture and nutty flavor. Toasting dry oats in butter for 2 minutes before adding water creates a protective nutty shell that prevents them from becoming gluey. Stirring buttermilk in at the end provides sophisticated tang that balances sweet brown sugar while adding creamy richness.

## Directions

1.  **The Toast:** In a heavy saucepan, melt the butter. Add the oats and stir constantly for 2-3 minutes until they smell like toasted popcorn and look golden.
2.  **Simmer:** Pour in the boiling water and a pinch of salt. Reduce heat to **very low**. Cover and cook for 25 minutes. **Do not stir.**
3.  **Emulsify:** Open the lid. Add the whole milk and half of the buttermilk. Stir gently for 10 minutes over low heat until the oats are creamy and "squeaky" to the bite (al dente).
4.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Stir in the remaining buttermilk, brown sugar, and cinnamon for the mandatory **High Note**.
5.  **Serve:** Serve hot with fresh berries or a drizzle of maple syrup.
