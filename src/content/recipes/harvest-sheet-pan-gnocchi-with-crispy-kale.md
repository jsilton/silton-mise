## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate high-performance nutritious dinner. The secret to its Success is **Textural Balance** through **The Crisp Kale Method**. Most sheet pan recipes turn kale into a soggy mess; here, we roast the kale alongside the gnocchi at high heat (400°F) until it dehydrates into Crunch chips. We use **The Staged Roast**: the gnocchi and squash develop a Texture in the oven without needing a separate boil. The smoked paprika and rosemary provide the mandatory savory **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2.  **Toss:** In a massive bowl, combine gnocchi, sliced sausage, squash, and kale. Drizzle with 3 tbsp olive oil. Add rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Toss until every leaf and cube is coated.
3.  **Spread:** Spread the mixture in a **single layer** on the pan. (Crucial for the kale to crisp!)
4.  **Roast:** Bake for 24-26 minutes, stirring once halfway through, until the squash is tender and the gnocchi are golden.
5.  **The Crunch:** The kale should be dark green and shatteringly crisp.
6.  **Finish:** Sprinkle with Parmesan or nutritional yeast while still piping hot. Serve immediately.
