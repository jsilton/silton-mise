## Chef's Note

This is a modern American sheet pan meal using Italian gnocchi, popularized in the 2010s as busy home cooks discovered that frozen gnocchi could go straight into the oven without boiling. The trick with kale is roasting it at high heat (400°F) until it becomes crispy like chips rather than wilting into a soggy mess - spread everything in a single layer so the kale can dehydrate properly. Cauliflower gnocchi is a more recent innovation from brands like Trader Joe's, offering a lower-carb alternative to traditional potato gnocchi. The combination of butternut squash, apple sausage, and rosemary is quintessential fall American comfort food.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2.  **Toss:** In a massive bowl, combine gnocchi, sliced sausage, squash, and kale. Drizzle with 3 tbsp olive oil. Add rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Toss until every leaf and cube is coated.
3.  **Spread:** Spread the mixture in a **single layer** on the pan. (Crucial for the kale to crisp!)
4.  **Roast:** Bake for 24-26 minutes, stirring once halfway through, until the squash is tender and the gnocchi are golden.
5.  **The Crunch:** The kale should be dark green and shatteringly crisp.
6.  **Finish:** Sprinkle with Parmesan or nutritional yeast while still piping hot. Serve immediately.
