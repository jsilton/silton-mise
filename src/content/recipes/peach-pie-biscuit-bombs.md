## Chef's Note

This is a high-speed **Updated Classic** update to the hand pie. The secret to its elite flavor is **The Beurre Noisette Method**: we brush the biscuits with butter that has been cooked until nutty and brown _before_ baking. This creates a toasted, savory Crunch that balances the creamy Brie and sweet peaches. We maintain **Textural Balance** by using Brie; the cheese acts as a thermal guard, preventing the peach juices from turning the biscuit base into mush.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment.
2.  **Split:** Pull each raw biscuit in half horizontally.
3.  **Layer:** Place 3 peach slices and 1 tsp of Brie in the center of the bottom half. Sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon. Drizzle with a drop of honey.
4.  **Seal:** Place the top half back on. Pinch the edges firmly and roll gently in your palms to form a uniform "ball." Arrange 2 inches apart on the pan.
5.  **The Sizzle:** In a small pan, melt 3 tbsp butter until it crackles and turns nutty brown. Brush each "bomb" generously with the brown butter.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 12-15 minutes until the tops are deep golden brown and the biscuit has a flaky "Bounce."
7.  **Serve:** Brush once more with the remaining brown butter. Serve warm while the Brie is molten.
