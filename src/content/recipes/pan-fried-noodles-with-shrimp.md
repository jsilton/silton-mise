## Directions

1. Prepare the seafood, sauce mixture, and vegetables
2. For this dish, we used scallops, shrimp, and prepared frozen squid that was already cleaned and cut. You can also prepare fresh squid. Do this by cutting the cleaned squid open lengthwise and lightly scoring it with a diamond pattern. See the technique we used in our Stir Fried Squid with Pickled Vegetables.
3. Prepare the sauce by mixing together your hot chicken stock with the sesame oil, salt, sugar, oyster sauce, white pepper. Set aside. Separately, mix the cornstarch and water into a slurry and set aside.
4. Cut the ends of your choy sum, wash it them well in cold water, and set aside. These will be left whole as they are served in Chinese restaurants.
5. Pan-fry the noodles
6. Bring a large pot or wok filled with water to a boil. If using fresh noodles, blanch them for 30-60 seconds. If using dried noodles, follow the package directions for cooking times, but make sure they remain al dente. In both cases, place the noodles directly into a cold water bath to stop the cooking and drain thoroughly in a colander.
7. Next, heat your wok or nonstick frying pan until hot. Add a tablespoon of oil and swirl it around so it coats your cooking surface. Spread out the noodles in a thin, even layer, and fry for 3 to 5 minutes or until crispy.
8. Use a spatula to loosen the noodles. Take a peek under the noodles to ensure they’re golden brown. Use a spatula to flip the noodles over. If you can’t get it in one shot, flip it over in sections.
9. Add another tablespoon of vegetable oil around the sides of the pan, and crisp the other side to get the noodles evenly browned. Transfer the noodles to a serving plate.
10. Pre-cook seafood and choy sum
11. Bring 6 cups of water to a boil in your wok (you can also use the water you boiled the noodles in), and add a tablespoon of oil to the water. Blanch the choy sum for 30 seconds. Remove with a Chinese spider or strainer shaking off the excess water and place around the noodles.
12. Next, blanch the shrimp, scallops, and squid by slowly stirring them in the water until just opaque (about 20 seconds). Transfer to a plate. The seafood should be just 70% cooked, since they will be cooked again in the stir-fry step of the dish.
13. Assemble the dish
14. Start with a clean, dry wok over medium low heat. Spread 1 tablespoon of oil around the perimeter of your wok. Add the ginger and cook for 10 to 20 seconds.
15. Stir in the garlic, scallions, carrots and mushrooms, turning the heat up to the highest setting. Next, add the shrimp, scallops, and squid. Stir-fry for 10 seconds, and add the wine.
16. Next, add the sauce mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir the cornstarch slurry to ensure it’s combined, and add ⅔ of it while stirring the contents of the wok. Cook for 15 seconds. The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon. Add the rest of the cornstarch slurry until the sauce is your preferred consistency.
17. Pour the entire mixture over the noodles and serve immediately. Serve with hot chili oil on the side!
