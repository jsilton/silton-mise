## Chef's Note

Pan-fried noodles (gon chow min) are a Cantonese restaurant specialty. The technique: boil noodles briefly, then pan-fry them into a crispy "bird's nest" cake—crunchy on the outside, soft inside. Treating shrimp with baking soda (then rinsing thoroughly) gives them a bouncy texture. The clear, golden gravy poured over the top softens the center noodles while leaving edges crispy. A dramatic presentation dish.

## Directions

1.  **The Crunch:** Toss shrimp with baking soda. Let sit for 5 minutes, then **rinse thoroughly** and pat dry.
2.  **The Noodles:** Boil noodles for 1 minute (al dente). Drain and rinse with cold water. Shake dry.
3.  **The Cake:** Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large non-stick pan. Spread noodles in an even layer. Fry undisturbed for 5 minutes until the bottom is a golden-brown disc. Flip (in sections if needed) and crisp the other side. Transfer to a platter.
4.  **The Veg:** Blanch the greens in boiling water for 30 seconds. Arrange around the noodles.
5.  **The Sear:** In a hot wok or skillet, sear the shrimp for 1 minute per side. Add ginger and garlic for 30 seconds. Splash in the Shaoxing wine.
6.  **The Gravy:** Pour in the sauce mixture (stock, oyster sauce, soy, pepper). Bring to a boil. Stir in the cornstarch slurry and cook until thickened and clear.
7.  **Serve:** Pour the hot shrimp gravy directly over the center of the crispy noodle cake. Serve immediately.
