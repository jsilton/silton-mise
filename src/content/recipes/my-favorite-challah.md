## Chef's Note

The challah is the ultimate test of **Culinary Technique** in the Executive bakery. The secret to its incredible Texture is **The Slow-Development Method**: we use a massive 5-egg base to ensure a rich, brioche-like crumb. We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The 6-Braid Method**: braiding the strands tightly creates internal tension that forces the bread to rise vertically, resulting in a tall, majestic loaf with a crispy golden crust. Always let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free spot (The Thermal Rise) to ensure the yeast fully activates.

## Directions

1.  **Activate:** In a massive bowl, whisk yeast and 1 tbsp sugar into 1 3/4 cups lukewarm water. Let stand for 10 minutes until foamy.
2.  **The Emulsion:** Whisk in the oil, 4 eggs, and the remaining sugar and salt.
3.  **Incorporate:** Gradually add the flour, 1 cup at a time, until a shaggy dough forms.
4.  **Knead:** Transfer to a floured surface. Knead by hand for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic (or use a stand mixer with a dough hook).
5.  **First Rise:** Place in a greased bowl, cover with plastic, and let rise in a warm spot for 1 hour until doubled.
6.  **Shape:** Punch down the dough. Divide into two halves. Divide each half into 6 balls. Roll each ball into a 12-inch strand.
7.  **The Braid:** Braid into two 6-strand loaves (see notes for braiding pattern). Place on a greased sheet.
8.  **Second Rise:** Brush with beaten egg. Let rise for another 45-60 minutes.
9.  **Bake:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Brush once more with egg and sprinkle with seeds. Bake for 35-40 minutes until deep mahogany brown.
10. **Cool:** Let cool completely on a rack before slicing.
