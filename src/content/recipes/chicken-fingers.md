## Chef's Note

We have upgraded the "shaking in a bag" method to the **Standard Breading Procedure**. By using **Panko** and Parmesan instead of crackers, we achieve a much lighter, crispier texture that doesn't turn greasy. The secret to the crunch is **High-Heat Roasting** on a wire rack—this allows the hot air to circulate under the chicken, ensuring it is crispy on all sides without needing deep frying.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Place a wire cooling rack on top of a large baking sheet. Spray the rack with oil.
2.  **Station:** Set up three shallow bowls:
    - Bowl 1: Flour, salt, and pepper.
    - Bowl 2: Beaten eggs.
    - Bowl 3: Panko, Parmesan, garlic powder, and oregano.
3.  **Bread:** Dip each chicken strip in flour (shake off excess), then egg, then press firmly into the panko mixture until fully coated.
4.  **Roast:** Arrange on the wire rack. Spray the tops of the chicken lightly with oil.
5.  **Crisp:** Bake for 12-15 minutes until golden brown and the internal temp is 165°F. (No need to flip if using a wire rack!).
6.  **Finish:** Serve hot with a squeeze of lemon or your favorite dipping sauce.
