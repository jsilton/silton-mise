## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate **Modularity** component for tacos and bowls. The secret to its Success is **The Salsa-Acid Pattern**: we slow-cook the chicken in a bath of salsa verde and Rotel; the acidity of the tomatillos acts as a continuous enzyme tenderizer, resulting in a protein that has a succulent "Bounce" rather than a stringy texture. We maintain **Texture Integrity** by adding the fresh lime juice and an extra pulse of cilantro only _after_ shredding—this provides the mandatory **High Note** of freshness.

## Directions

1.  **Combine:** In a 6-quart slow cooker, combine chicken, beans, tomatoes, corn, salsa, cilantro, onion, jalapeño, and spices.
2.  **Cook:** Cover and cook on **Low for 7-8 hours** (or High for 3-4 hours).
3.  **The Pull:** Using two forks, shred the chicken directly in the pot. Stir to ensure every strand is coated in the spicy juices.
4.  **Finish:** Stir in the fresh lime juice. Season with a generous amount of sea salt and pepper.
5.  **Serve:** Serve immediately in charred tortillas or over [Cilantro Lime Rice](/recipes/cilantro-lime-rice).
