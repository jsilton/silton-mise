## Chef's Note

This Tex-Mex slow-cooker chicken cooks in a bath of salsa verde and Rotel tomatoes, where the tomatillos' natural acidity tenderizes the meat over long cooking. After shredding, fresh lime juice and cilantro stirred in at the end provide bright, fresh flavor that contrasts the slow-cooked base.

## Directions

1.  **Combine:** In a 6-quart slow cooker, combine chicken, beans, tomatoes, corn, salsa, cilantro, onion, jalapeño, and spices.
2.  **Cook:** Cover and cook on **Low for 7-8 hours** (or High for 3-4 hours).
3.  **The Pull:** Using two forks, shred the chicken directly in the pot. Stir to ensure every strand is coated in the spicy juices.
4.  **Finish:** Stir in the fresh lime juice. Season with a generous amount of sea salt and pepper.
5.  **Serve:** Serve immediately in charred tortillas or over [Cilantro Lime Rice](/mise/recipes/cilantro-lime-rice).
