## Chef's Note

"Suizas" means Swiss-style, referring to the heavy use of cream and cheese. This is a **"Wet/Fork" Mexican main** that balances the tartness of roasted tomatillos with the richness of heavy cream. To prevent the tortillas from turning into mush, we lightly fry them in oil for 10 seconds before filling—this creates a fat barrier that holds the structure under the sauce.

## Directions

1.  **Roast:** Place tomatillos, jalapeños, onion, and garlic on a baking sheet. Broil for 5-7 minutes until charred and softened.
2.  **Blend:** Place the roasted veg in a blender with the cilantro and heavy cream. Blend until smooth. Season with salt.
3.  **Prep Tortillas:** Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a small skillet. Dip each tortilla in the oil for 5-10 seconds per side (until pliable but not crisp). Drain on paper towels.
4.  **Assemble:** Dip a tortilla in the green sauce, fill with shredded chicken and a sprinkle of cheese, and roll tightly. Place in a baking dish.
5.  **Bake:** Pour the remaining sauce over the top and cover with the rest of the cheese. Bake at 375°F for 15-20 minutes until the cheese is bubbling.
6.  **Finish:** Top with pickled red onions and fresh cilantro.
