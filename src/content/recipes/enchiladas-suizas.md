## Chef's Note

Enchiladas Suizas (Swiss-style) refers to the generous use of cream and cheese, a style that originated in Mexico City in the 1950s. The dish balances tart, roasted tomatillos with rich heavy cream. Briefly frying tortillas in oil for 10 seconds before filling creates a protective layer that prevents them from dissolving under the wet sauce.

## Directions

1.  **Roast:** Place tomatillos, jalapeños, onion, and garlic on a baking sheet. Broil for 5-7 minutes until charred and softened.
2.  **Blend:** Place the roasted veg in a blender with the cilantro and heavy cream. Blend until smooth. Season with salt.
3.  **Prep Tortillas:** Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a small skillet. Dip each tortilla in the oil for 5-10 seconds per side (until pliable but not crisp). Drain on paper towels.
4.  **Assemble:** Dip a tortilla in the green sauce, fill with shredded chicken and a sprinkle of cheese, and roll tightly. Place in a baking dish.
5.  **Bake:** Pour the remaining sauce over the top and cover with the rest of the cheese. Bake at 375°F for 15-20 minutes until the cheese is bubbling.
6.  **Finish:** Top with pickled red onions and fresh cilantro.
