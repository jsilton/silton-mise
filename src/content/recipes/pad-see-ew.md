## Chef's Note
This is our high-speed "Fuel" version of the Thai classic. The secret to Success is **The Noodle Prep Pattern**: if your rice noodles are cold, you must microwave them for 30 seconds before adding to the wok; this ensures they are flexible and provides the mandatory "Bounce" rather than breaking into small pieces. We use **The Staged Wilt**: we add the broccoli stems with the meat, then the leaves only during the final 30 seconds—this ensures **Texture Integrity** throughout the dish.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Cut noodles into 1-inch strips. Slice Gai Lan into 2-inch pieces, halving any thick stems vertically.
2.  **The Sear:** Heat oil in a wok over high. Sauté garlic for 10 seconds. Add the meat and Gai Lan stems. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until the meat is browned.
3.  **The Scorch:** Add the noodles. Let them sit undisturbed for 20 seconds to develop a char.
4.  **Season:** Add both soy sauces and sugar. Toss vigorously over high heat until the noodles are evenly lacquered.
5.  **The Egg:** Push noodles to the side. Crack the egg into the center. Scramble until set, then fold into the noodles.
6.  **Finish:** Add the Gai Lan leaves. Toss for 30 seconds until just wilted. Serve immediately.
