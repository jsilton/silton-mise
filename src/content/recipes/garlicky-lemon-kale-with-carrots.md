## Chef's Note

Kale has experienced a massive surge in popularity over the past decade, transforming from a garnish to a nutritional superstar. The key to cooking kale is quick, high-heat sautéing followed by a brief steam - this wilts the tough leaves while preserving their bright green color and preventing bitterness. The carrots add sweetness and crunch to balance the slightly bitter, earthy kale. Lemon juice at the end brightens everything and helps your body absorb the iron in the kale. This technique works for any hearty green: collards, Swiss chard, or mustard greens.

## Directions

1.  **Prep the Kale:** Remove the tough center stems from the kale leaves by folding each leaf in half and slicing out the stem. Roughly chop the leaves into 2-inch pieces. You should have about 8 cups of loosely packed chopped kale.

2.  **Sauté the Carrots:** Heat olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the sliced carrots and sauté for 3-4 minutes, tossing frequently, until they begin to soften and develop some color on the edges.

3.  **Add Garlic:** Add the minced garlic to the carrots and sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant. Don't let the garlic burn.

4.  **Wilt the Kale:** Add the chopped kale to the skillet. It will seem like a huge amount, but it will shrink dramatically. Toss the kale with tongs to coat it in the oil and garlic.

5.  **Steam:** Add the water or broth to the skillet and immediately cover with a lid. Let the kale steam for 2-3 minutes until it wilts and becomes tender but is still bright green.

6.  **Finish:** Remove the lid and toss the vegetables until any excess liquid evaporates (30-60 seconds). Remove from heat. Add lemon juice, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes if using. For an Asian-style version, drizzle with sesame oil. Toss well.

7.  **Taste and Adjust:** Taste and add more salt, lemon juice, or pepper as needed. Serve immediately while still warm.

## Variations

**Mediterranean Style:** Add 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts or slivered almonds and 2 tbsp golden raisins in step 6.

**Asian Style:** Use sesame oil instead of olive oil, add 1 tbsp soy sauce in step 6, and garnish with sesame seeds.

**Spicy Style:** Double the red pepper flakes or add 1 tsp sriracha sauce in step 6.
