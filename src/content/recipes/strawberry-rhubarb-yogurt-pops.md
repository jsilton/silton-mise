## Chef's Note

The secret to a "Gold Standard" yogurt pop is **Structural Science** through **The Reduction Pattern**. You must simmer the strawberries and rhubarb with the orange juice for 4 minutes; this breaks down the tough rhubarb fibers and creates a thick, pectin-rich syrup that prevents the pops from becoming "icy bricks." We use **Greek Yogurt** as the primary emulsifier to provide a creamy "Bounce." The orange juice provides the mandatory **Acid Finish** that bridges the sweet honey and tart rhubarb.

## Directions

1.  **The Fruit:** In a small saucepan, combine minced strawberries, rhubarb, orange juice, and salt.
2.  **Simmer:** Cook over medium heat for 4 minutes until the fruit collapses and the liquid is syrupy. Let cool.
3.  **Reserve:** Using a slotted spoon, set aside 1/2 cup of the cooked fruit pieces.
4.  **Emulsify:** Transfer the remaining fruit and liquid to a blender. Add the yogurt and honey. Puree until perfectly smooth and vibrant pink.
5.  **Assemble:** Stir the reserved fruit pieces back into the puree (The Texture Snap). Divide the mixture among 10 popsicle molds.
6.  **Set:** Freeze for 1 hour. Insert sticks. Freeze for **at least 3 more hours** until rock-solid.
7.  **Serve:** Run molds under warm water for 10 seconds to release. Serve immediately.
