## Directions

1. In a bowl, combine sauce ingredients.
2. Slice your unpeeled eggplant vertically into quarter long strips. Then cut the strips into 1.5-inch-long pieces. Transfer to a large bowl. Pour cornstarch over eggplant. Using your hands, coat chopped eggplant in cornstarch. Note: The cornstarch helps the sauce cling onto your eggplant.
3. In a wok or pan over medium high heat, add ¼ cup vegetable oil. Once oil is hot, add eggplant. Fry until 80% cooked. Remove from wok and set aside.
4. Lower heat to low-medium. Into wok, add 1 tablespoon of oil along with dried red chilies, ginger, and green onions. Fry for 5-10 seconds.
5. Add back in eggplant. Pour sauce overtop.
6. Quickly mix until eggplant is coated in sauce. Remove off heat and enjoy!
