## Chef's Note

The tragedy of home-cooked eggplant is "The Mush." We solve this with the **Silton Texture Pattern**: we coat the eggplant in cornstarch and sear it at high heat _before_ adding the sauce. This creates a protective crust that stays meaty while the inside turns creamy. We use our modular [Chinese Garlic Sauce](/recipes/chinese-garlic-sauce-base) to finish the dish with a professional, glossy glaze.

## Directions

1.  **Dredge:** Toss the eggplant batons in a bowl with cornstarch until every side is coated. This is the secret to the texture.
2.  **Sear:** Heat 3 tbsp oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add the eggplant in a single layer. Sear for 3-4 minutes, turning once, until the edges are golden and crispy. Remove to a plate.
3.  **Aromatics:** Wipe out the pan. Add 1 tbsp oil. Sauté the garlic, ginger, and the white parts of the scallions for 30 seconds. Stir in the chili paste.
4.  **Finish:** Return the eggplant to the pan. Pour in the [All-Purpose Chinese Garlic Sauce](/recipes/chinese-garlic-sauce-base). Toss vigorously for 1 minute until the sauce bubbles and turns into a thick, clear glaze.
5.  **Serve:** Garnish with the green parts of the scallions.
