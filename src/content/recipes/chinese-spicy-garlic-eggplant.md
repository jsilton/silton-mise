## Chef's Note

Spicy garlic eggplant is a Sichuan favorite. The trick to avoiding mushy eggplant: coat the batons in cornstarch before searing. This creates a protective crust that stays meaty and slightly crispy while the inside turns creamy. Chinese eggplants (the long, thin ones) work best since they have fewer seeds and less moisture. The all-purpose Chinese garlic sauce creates a professional glossy glaze in seconds.

## Directions

1.  **Dredge:** Toss the eggplant batons in a bowl with cornstarch until every side is coated. This is the secret to the texture.
2.  **Sear:** Heat 3 tbsp oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add the eggplant in a single layer. Sear for 3-4 minutes, turning once, until the edges are golden and crispy. Remove to a plate.
3.  **Aromatics:** Wipe out the pan. Add 1 tbsp oil. Sauté the garlic, ginger, and the white parts of the scallions for 30 seconds. Stir in the chili paste.
4.  **Finish:** Return the eggplant to the pan. Pour in the [All-Purpose Chinese Garlic Sauce](/silton-mise/recipes/chinese-garlic-sauce-base). Toss vigorously for 1 minute until the sauce bubbles and turns into a thick, clear glaze.
5.  **Serve:** Garnish with the green parts of the scallions.
