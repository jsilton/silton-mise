## Directions

1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease 2 (8-inch) round cake pans with butter, lard or pan spray. Dust each greased pan with 1 tablespoon of flour, and shake the pan to spread and coat the flour over the oil. Mix 1 1/2 cups flour, the sugar, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, nutmeg, salt, oil, eggs and carrots, stirring until the batter is smooth. Divide the batter between the 2 greased pans. Bake until the cake starts to pull slightly away from the sides of the pan, about 25-30 minutes. Set aside to cool. Once cooled, remove the cakes from the pans.
2. Make the frosting: Place the cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, vanilla and salt in a mixing bowl. Use a tabletop mixer, or an electric beater to combine all ingredients until smooth.
3. Make the syrup: Add the grated apple, sugar and water to a small saucepan. Bring to a rolling boil, then remove from heat. Strain the mixture through a strainer and discard the solids.
4. Assemble the cake: Using a serrated knife, remove the muffin-like top from both cakes. Discard the removed part or feed it to your children or your chickens. Using a pastry brush, lightly glaze the top of each cake with about 1 tablespoon of the syrup mixture. You will not use all of the syrup. Discard what you don’t use or save it to mix with recreational spirits. Spread 1/3 of the frosting on top of 1 of the cakes. Set the other cake on top to create 2 layers. Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of the cake. Serves 12.
