## Chef's Note

This Mercer Street classic is elevated using Stella Parks' (Bravetart) brown butter technique. By replacing generic vegetable oil with toasted brown butter, you inject a deep, nutty complexity that perfectly complements the carrots and spices. The apple syrup is the final secret—it is brushed onto the warm cake layers to ensure they stay moist and add a subtle tartness that balances the rich cream cheese frosting.

## Directions

1.  **Brown the Butter:** Melt the 2/3 cup butter in a pan until the solids turn dark brown and smell nutty. Cool to room temperature.
2.  **Bake:** Whisk the brown butter with eggs, carrots, and sugar. Fold in the dry ingredients. Pour into two 8-inch greased pans. Bake at 350°F for 25-30 minutes.
3.  **The Syrup:** Boil the apple, sugar, and water for 5 minutes. Strain and discard solids. **Brush the warm syrup** over the warm cake layers immediately after removing them from the pans.
4.  **Frosting:** Beat the cream cheese and butter until smooth. Add powdered sugar and vanilla.
5.  **Assemble:** Layer the cakes with a thick spread of frosting between them. Frost the top and sides generously.
