## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate **Modularity** component—the "Silton Side" that goes with everything. The secret to its "Box Quality" flavor without the preservatives is **Structural Science** through **The Orzo Toast Pattern**. You must toast the dry orzo in butter until it reaches a deep "mahogany" brown; this develops a nutty complex that defines the dish. We use **Turmeric** as a structural visual hack to provide the mandatory golden glow. The 10-minute **Steam Cycle** is mandatory for **Texture Integrity**—it ensures every grain is distinct and has a resilient "Bounce."

## Directions

1.  **The Toast:** In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add the orzo. Stir frequently for 3-4 minutes until the pasta is deep golden brown. Watch closely; it burns quickly.
2.  **The Grain:** Add the rice. Stir for 1 minute until the grains are coated in butter and look translucent at the edges.
3.  **Season:** Stir in garlic powder, onion powder, and turmeric. Sauté for 30 seconds until the spices are fragrant.
4.  **Simmer:** Pour in the chicken broth. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil.
5.  **The Set:** Reduce heat to low. Cover tightly with a lid. Simmer for 15-18 minutes until the liquid is fully absorbed.
6.  **The Steam:** Remove from heat. **Do not open the lid.** Let the rice steam for 10 minutes (mandatory for structure).
7.  **Finish:** Remove lid, stir in dried parsley, and fluff with a fork.
