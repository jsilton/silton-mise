## Description

This is the homemade version of the classic "box rice" that goes with everything. Toasting the orzo in butter provides that signature nutty flavor, while the turmeric gives it the golden glow.

## Directions

1.  Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the orzo and cook, stirring frequently, until it turns a deep golden brown (about 3-4 minutes). Watch closely so it doesn't burn.
2.  Add the rice and stir to coat in the butter, toasting for another minute.
3.  Add the garlic powder, onion powder, and turmeric. Stir for 30 seconds until fragrant.
4.  Pour in the chicken broth. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil.
5.  Reduce heat to low, cover tightly with a lid, and simmer for 15-18 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender.
6.  Remove from heat. **Do not open the lid.** Let it steam for 5-10 minutes.
7.  Remove lid, stir in the dried parsley, fluff with a fork, and serve.
