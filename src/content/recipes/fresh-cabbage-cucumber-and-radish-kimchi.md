## Directions

1. Put the cabbage, cucumbers, daikon and radishes in 4 separate bowls. Add 2 tablespoons of the kosher salt to each bowl and toss well to coat the vegetables. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour.
2. Meanwhile, in a blender, combine all of the remaining ingredients and puree until almost smooth.
3. Drain the vegetables thoroughly and gently squeeze out any excess water. In a large bowl, toss all of the vegetables with the ginger-gochugaru dressing. Cover the kimchi and refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving.

Gochugaru is available at Asian markets, stores like Whole Foods and amazon.com.
