## Chef's Note

This is a baseline **Modern Heritage** recipe for the Silton pantry. The secret to a crisp, non-watery kimchi is **Structural Science** through **The Osmotic Cure Pattern**. By salting the vegetables heavily for an hour, we draw out the excess moisture that would otherwise dilute the spice paste. We use a **Triple Veg Pattern** (Cabbage, Cucumber, Daikon) to ensure a complex array of "Snaps" and "Bounces" in every serving. Always use **Gochugaru**—the specific smoky heat is the mandatory high note.

## Directions

1.  **The Cure:** In four separate large bowls, divide the cabbage, cucumbers, daikon, and radishes. Sprinkle 2 tbsp of salt into each bowl and toss well. **Let stand for 1 hour** at room temperature.
2.  **The Paste:** In a high-powered blender, combine ginger, garlic, gochugaru, rice vinegar, sesame oil, fish sauce, scallions, and sugar. Puree until almost smooth.
3.  **The Rinse:** Drain the vegetables thoroughly. Gently squeeze each handful to remove all remaining water.
4.  **The Bind:** In one massive bowl, toss all the vegetables with the kimchi paste until every piece is uniformly coated in the deep red glaze.
5.  **The Set:** Transfer to glass jars. Cover and refrigerate for **at least 4 hours** (ideally 24) to allow the flavors to meld and the fermentation to begin.
6.  **Serve:** This fresh kimchi (Geotjeori style) is at its best within the first week.
