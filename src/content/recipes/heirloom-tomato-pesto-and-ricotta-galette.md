## Chef's Note

Galettes are rustic free-form tarts from France, though Italians have embraced them with summer ingredients like tomatoes and pesto. The key to avoiding a soggy crust is simple: slice your tomatoes and pat them dry with paper towels for 10 minutes to remove excess moisture. For the flakiest pastry, keep your butter cold and in pea-sized pieces—a food processor makes this easy.

## Directions

1.  **The Crust:** In a food processor, pulse flour, sugar, and salt. Add cold butter; pulse until it looks like coarse meal. Drizzle in ice water; pulse 2-3 times until dough just holds together. Form into a disk, wrap in plastic, and **chill for 30 minutes** (The Gluten Rest).
2.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
3.  **The Dry Method:** Slice heirloom tomatoes and place them on paper towels. Pat the tops with more towels to absorb all surface moisture.
4.  **Assemble:** Roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Spread pesto over the center, leaving a 2-inch border. Add dollops of ricotta.
5.  **Layer:** Arrange the dry tomato slices over the ricotta.
6.  **The Fold:** Gently fold the edges of the dough over the tomatoes, pleating as you go. Brush the crust edges with olive oil and sprinkle with the shredded cheese.
7.  **Bake:** Bake for 25-30 minutes until the crust is deep golden brown and the tomatoes are concentrated.
8.  **Serve:** Garnish with flaky salt, chili flakes, and fresh herbs for the mandatory **High Note**.
