## Directions

1. For the Homemade Pie Crust: In a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Pulse to mix. Add the cubed butter and pulse until crumb-like texture. Add the ice-cold water to pulse 2-3 times until the dough is moist.
2. Transfer the dough onto plastic wrap to press out into a 1” thick disc. Wrap tightly and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.
3. For the Galette: Preheat oven to 425F.
4. Roll out the chilled pie crust dough to a 12” - 14” circle.
5. Spoon the basil pesto evenly over the dough leaving a 2” – 3” border along the edges to fold over later. Add dollops of the ricotta.
6. Pat dry the thinly sliced tomatoes with a paper towel to remove as much moisture as possible. Layer the tomatoes onto the dough.
7. Gently fold over the edges so it overlaps the tomatoes, then brush the edges with the olive oil. Sprinkle the shredded cheese over the crust.
8. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until edges are golden brown, and tomatoes are juicy.
9. Enjoy warm garnished with a drizzle of olive oil, more dollops of ricotta, flaky salt, chili pepper flakes, and freshly chopped herbs.
