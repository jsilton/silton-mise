## Chef's Note

This is the definitive "Summer Project" cake. The secret to its Success is **The Surface Press Method**: you must arrange the strawberries cut-side down in a single, tight layer over the entire surface of the batter. As the cake bakes, the strawberries sink slightly and release their juices, creating a jammy Texture while the exposed edges develop a caramelized "Snap." We use a **High-Sugar Crust**: sprinkling extra sugar over the raw berries creates a crackly, crystalline "High Note" finish that defines the dish.

## Directions

1.  **Cream:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan (mandatory for volume). Beat butter and 1 cup sugar for 3 minutes until pale and fluffy.
2.  **Emulsify:** Add the egg, milk, and vanilla. Beat until perfectly smooth.
3.  **Incorporate:** Gradually add the flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix until **just smooth**—do not over-mix.
4.  **Layer:** Pour batter into the pan. Arrange strawberries on top, cut-side down, as closely as possible.
5.  **The Crunch:** Sprinkle the remaining 2 tbsp sugar over the berries.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 10 minutes at 350°F, then **reduce heat to 325°F**. Roast for 50-60 minutes until the top is golden and a tester comes out clean.
7.  **Serve:** Let cool completely in the pan. Serve with lightly whipped cream.
