## Chef's Note

Red velvet originated in the South during the Victorian era when "velvet cakes" described fine-crumbed, tender cakes made with buttermilk. Buttermilk, vinegar, and natural cocoa powder react with baking soda to create a tall, airy crumb. Whipping egg whites separately and folding them in at the end provides cloud-like lightness, while adding cornstarch mimics cake flour for a delicate texture rather than a dense, bready one.

## Directions

1.  **Aeration:** In a clean bowl, beat the 2 egg whites until stiff peaks form. Set aside.
2.  **Dry Mix:** Sift together flour, cornstarch, cocoa, baking soda, and salt.
3.  **The Emulsion:** In a stand mixer, cream butter and sugar for 2 minutes. Add oil and beat on high until light. Whisk in yolks, vanilla, vinegar, and food coloring until vibrant red.
4.  **Combine:** Alternately add the dry mix and the buttermilk to the butter mixture, beginning and ending with the dry. **Do not over-mix.**
5.  **The Fold:** Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the batter with a spatula until just incorporated.
6.  **Bake:** Divide into a lined 12-cup tin (filling 2/3 full). Bake at 350°F for 20-21 minutes until the tops spring back.
7.  **Cool:** Let cool **completely** before frosting.
8.  **Finish:** Top with a massive dollop of [Cream Cheese Frosting](/mise/recipes/favorite-cream-cheese-frosting).
