## Chef's Note

Hot and sour soup is a Sichuan/Hunan classic. The name is literal: "hot" from white pepper (not just chilies) and "sour" from rice vinegar. To get long, silken egg ribbons instead of clumps, stir the soup vigorously in one direction to create a vortex, then slowly stream in beaten egg while the liquid is moving. Cornstarch thickens the broth and helps suspend the pork and mushrooms evenly. Wood ear mushrooms and bamboo shoots add traditional texture.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Soak dried mushrooms in boiling water for 30 minutes. Drain, rinse, and slice.
2.  **Infuse:** In a large pot, heat 2 tbsp oil. Sauté ginger and chili paste for 1 minute. Add the BBQ pork, wood ears, and bamboo shoots.
3.  **Boil:** Pour in the [Chinese Chicken Stock](/silton-mise/recipes/cantonese-wonton-broth). Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes.
4.  **Season:** Stir in the soy sauce, vinegar, and white pepper. Taste—it should be sharp and punchy.
5.  **Tofu:** Add the tofu strips and simmer for 3 minutes.
6.  **Bind:** Stir the cornstarch slurry and slowly pour into the soup. Simmer for 2 minutes until the soup is thick and clear.
7.  **The Current:** Remove from heat. Stir the soup vigorously in one direction to create a current. Stop stirring and slowly stream in the beaten egg.
8.  **Serve:** Ladle into bowls and garnish with sesame oil and fresh scallions for the final **High Note**.
