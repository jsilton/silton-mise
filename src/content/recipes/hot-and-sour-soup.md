## Chef's Note

This is the "Kitchen Standard" for technical Chinese soups. The name is literal: the "Hot" comes from white pepper, not just chilies, and the "Sour" from rice vinegar. The secret to its elite texture is **Culinary Technique** through **The Egg Current Method**: you must stir the soup in one direction to create a vortex, then slowly stream the egg into the moving liquid—this ensures the egg forms long, silken "ribbons" rather than clumps. We use **The Cornstarch Bind** to create a thick, glossy Texture that suspends the pork and wood ears uniformly.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Soak dried mushrooms in boiling water for 30 minutes. Drain, rinse, and slice.
2.  **Infuse:** In a large pot, heat 2 tbsp oil. Sauté ginger and chili paste for 1 minute. Add the BBQ pork, wood ears, and bamboo shoots.
3.  **Boil:** Pour in the [Chinese Chicken Stock](/silton-mise/recipes/cantonese-wonton-broth). Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes.
4.  **Season:** Stir in the soy sauce, vinegar, and white pepper. Taste—it should be sharp and punchy.
5.  **Tofu:** Add the tofu strips and simmer for 3 minutes.
6.  **Bind:** Stir the cornstarch slurry and slowly pour into the soup. Simmer for 2 minutes until the soup is thick and clear.
7.  **The Current:** Remove from heat. Stir the soup vigorously in one direction to create a current. Stop stirring and slowly stream in the beaten egg.
8.  **Serve:** Ladle into bowls and garnish with sesame oil and fresh scallions for the final **High Note**.
