## Chef's Note

The challenge with eggplant is preventing it from becoming an oil-soaked sponge. We use **Textural Balance** through the **Perimeter Sear Method**: instead of deep-frying, we sear the eggplant in a lightly oiled wok over medium heat until the skin is purple-gold and the flesh is translucent but holds its shape. We use the **Angle Cut** (triangular chunks) to maximize the surface area for the **Garlic Sauce** to cling to. The hit of rice vinegar at the end provides the mandatory **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **The Sauce:** Whisk together all garlic sauce ingredients (including half of the minced garlic) until the sugar and cornstarch are dissolved. Set aside.
2.  **Angle Cut:** Cut eggplants on an angle, rotating the eggplant 90 degrees after each cut to create triangular chunks.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat 1.5 tbsp oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Spread eggplant in a single layer. Sear for 4 minutes, flipping occasionally until browned. Add another 1.5 tbsp oil if needed and continue for 4 more minutes until soft but not mushy. Remove eggplant.
4.  **Aromatics:** Increase heat to high. Add remaining oil. Brown the ground pork (if using). Add the ginger, chilies, and the remaining garlic. Stir-fry for 1 minute until fragrant.
5.  **The Glaze:** Add eggplant back to the wok. Give the sauce a final stir and pour it in.
6.  **Simmer:** Simmer for 1-2 minutes until the sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon and the eggplant is glossy.
7.  **Finish:** Stir in scallions and serve immediately with steamed rice.
