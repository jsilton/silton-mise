## Chef's Note

Chinese eggplant with garlic sauce (yu xiang qiezi) is a Sichuan restaurant classic. The challenge is preventing eggplant from absorbing too much oil. Instead of deep-frying, sear it in a lightly oiled wok over medium heat until the skin is golden and the flesh is translucent but holds its shape. Cutting on an angle into triangular chunks maximizes surface area for the sauce to cling. Rice vinegar at the end brightens the rich, savory flavors.

## Directions

1.  **The Sauce:** Whisk together all garlic sauce ingredients (including half of the minced garlic) until the sugar and cornstarch are dissolved. Set aside.
2.  **Angle Cut:** Cut eggplants on an angle, rotating the eggplant 90 degrees after each cut to create triangular chunks.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat 1.5 tbsp oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Spread eggplant in a single layer. Sear for 4 minutes, flipping occasionally until browned. Add another 1.5 tbsp oil if needed and continue for 4 more minutes until soft but not mushy. Remove eggplant.
4.  **Aromatics:** Increase heat to high. Add remaining oil. Brown the ground pork (if using). Add the ginger, chilies, and the remaining garlic. Stir-fry for 1 minute until fragrant.
5.  **The Glaze:** Add eggplant back to the wok. Give the sauce a final stir and pour it in.
6.  **Simmer:** Simmer for 1-2 minutes until the sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon and the eggplant is glossy.
7.  **Finish:** Stir in scallions and serve immediately with steamed rice.
