## Directions

1. Blueberry Crisp:1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease a 9-inch square baking dish.2. In a large saucepan, combine blueberries, water and lemon juice over medium heat. In a small bowl, stir together sugar and cornstarch. When blueberry mixture begins to bubble around the edges, add sugar and cornstarch. Cook until mixture thickens, stirring constantly, about 4 minutes.3. Pour mixture into prepared baking dish. Top with Brown Butter Crumble and bake 30 minutes or until crumble is golden brown and fruit is bubbling throughout. Allow to cool slightly before serving, and serve with ice cream, if desired.
2. Brown Butter Crumble:1. In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Continue heating until the butter turns brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and strain butter into a bowl to remove browned milk solids. Put the bowl of butter into an ice bath or refrigerator until it becomes solid.2. In a large bowl, combine flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar and salt. Cut in browned butter and combine until mixture forms small clumps. Pour onto a sheet pan and refrigerate until needed. May be made ahead and refrigerated, covered, up to 1 week ahead.

In a small bowl, whisk the eggs. Add a few tablespoons of the hot half-and-half mixture and whisk to combine. Continue adding hot mixture until eggs are warm, then pour all the eggs into the saucepan and whisk constantly cook over low heat until mixture reaches 160 degrees and coats the back of a metal spoon, about 5 minutes.

Churn ice cream according to the manufacturer directions for your ice cream machine. Move to a container, cover and freeze at least 4 hours before serving.

## Notes

The crisp recipe works for all kinds of fruit so when peaches are in season, or strawberries, or cherries, feel free to swap out the main ingredient. The restaurant bakes this in individual ramekins, but we modified it for one 9-inch baking dish.How much Brown Butter Crumble to add is up to you. Kinkead says, “I personally just sprinkle the top with the crumble and let the fruit bubble through when baked, but if you like a thicker crust then use more of the crumble.” She created the crumble recipe by modifying the streusel she developed for her blackberry muffins. When she makes the crisp with cherries, she adds almond flour and sliced almonds. With peaches, she adds a little toasted chopped pecan.The recipe will likely make more crumble than you’ll need for the crisp. Save it and use it on your next batch of muffins.Vanilla Bean Ice CreamWe’ve cut down this recipe to an eighth the size they make at Parish. The restaurant uses an ice cream stabilizer, Cremodan 30, in the big batch they make. It adds to the creaminess of the mixture and keeps ice crystals from forming. You can buy it at Amazon and add 4 grams when you add the sugar to the hot half-and-half mixture, or make the ice cream without it as we did. Still delicious and creamy.
