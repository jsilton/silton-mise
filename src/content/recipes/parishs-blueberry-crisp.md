## Chef's Note

This is a **Modern Heritage** update to a classic summer crisp. The secret to its elite depth is **The Beurre Noisette Pattern**: we cook the butter until it reaches its nutty, brown peak _before_ mixing it with the flour and sugar. This creates a crumble with a sophisticated "Snap" that standard butter lacks. We maintain **Texture Integrity** by simmering the blueberries with lemon juice and cornstarch first; this ensures the fruit sets into a thick, glossy jam that doesn't turn the topping soggy. The lemon juice provides the mandatory **Acid Finish**.

## Directions

1.  **The Fruit:** In a saucepan, combine blueberries, 1/4 cup water, and lemon juice. Whisk sugar and cornstarch together and stir into the fruit. Cook over medium for 4 minutes until the juices thicken. Pour into a greased 9-inch square dish.
2.  **The Crumble:** In a small pan, melt butter over medium-high. Continue heating for 5 minutes, stirring often, until the milk solids turn dark brown and smell like toasted nuts. Remove from heat immediately.
3.  **The Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk flour, brown sugar, and salt. Drizzle the brown butter over the mix. Stir with a fork until large, "Snappy" clumps form.
4.  **Bake:** Sprinkle the crumble generously over the fruit. Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes until the fruit is bubbling and the topping is a deep mahogany.
5.  **Serve:** Let cool for 10 minutes to allow the syrup to set. Serve warm with a scoop of [Vanilla Ice Cream](/recipes/old-fashioned-vanilla-ice-cream).
