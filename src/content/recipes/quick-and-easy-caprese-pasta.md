## Chef's Note

This pasta transforms the classic Caprese salad (from the island of Capri) into a quick summer dinner. Insalata Caprese - tomato, mozzarella, and basil - has been served in Capri since the 1950s, representing the colors of the Italian flag. The trick here is using residual heat: turn off the stove after briefly sautéing the tomatoes, then let the hot pasta melt the fresh mozzarella into a semi-molten state rather than cooking it into rubber. Seed the tomatoes first to remove excess liquid that would make the sauce watery. Angel hair cooks in 2-3 minutes, making this a true 15-minute meal. Use the ripest summer tomatoes you can find.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook angel hair in a massive pot of salted water for exactly 2-3 minutes (very al dente). Drain.
2.  **The Base:** In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium. Sauté garlic and Italian seasoning for 1 minute until fragrant.
3.  **Stage 2:** Add the chopped tomatoes. Sauté for only 2 minutes—you want them to stay "Snappy," not turn into a puree.
4.  **Bind:** Remove the skillet from the heat. Immediately add the hot pasta and the lemon juice. Toss vigorously.
5.  **Emulsify:** Add the fresh mozzarella and basil. Toss for 30 seconds until the cheese just begins to soften and pull.
6.  **Serve:** Season generously with black pepper. Serve immediately while the cheese is at its peak "Bounce."
