## Chef's Note

This is the baseline for 15-minute "Speed" fuel. The secret to its Success is **The Residual Heat Pattern**: angel hair is too delicate for heavy cooking; we sauté the garlic and tomatoes briefly, then kill the heat and let the hot pasta melt the mozzarella into a semi-molten "Bounce." We maintain **Texture Integrity** by seeding the tomatoes—this prevents the sauce from turning watery. The lemon juice provides the mandatory **Acid Finish** that bridge the sweet basil and rich oil.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook angel hair in a massive pot of salted water for exactly 2-3 minutes (very al dente). Drain.
2.  **The Base:** In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium. Sauté garlic and Italian seasoning for 1 minute until fragrant.
3.  **Stage 2:** Add the chopped tomatoes. Sauté for only 2 minutes—you want them to stay "Snappy," not turn into a puree.
4.  **Bind:** Remove the skillet from the heat. Immediately add the hot pasta and the lemon juice. Toss vigorously.
5.  **Emulsify:** Add the fresh mozzarella and basil. Toss for 30 seconds until the cheese just begins to soften and pull.
6.  **Serve:** Season generously with black pepper. Serve immediately while the cheese is at its peak "Bounce."
