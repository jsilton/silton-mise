## Chef's Note

Piccata comes from the Italian word 'piccato,' meaning 'larded' or 'pounded thin,' though the lemon-caper sauce preparation is more associated with Italian-American cooking than traditional Italian cuisine. It became popular in American trattorias in the mid-20th century as a lighter alternative to heavier cream-based dishes. The key to a glossy, restaurant-quality sauce is whisking cold butter into the hot pan off the heat - this creates an emulsion that clings to the chicken rather than separating into oil.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Pound chicken cutlets to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Season generously with salt and pepper.
2.  **Sear:** Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear chicken for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through. Remove to a plate.
3.  **Aromatics:** Reduce heat to medium. Add garlic and capers to the pan. Sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant.
4.  **Deglaze:** Pour in chicken broth and lemon juice. Scrape the bottom of the pan to release the fond. Simmer for 3 minutes to reduce by a third.
5.  **The Magic:** Turn off the heat. Add the cold butter cubes and whisk vigorously until melted into a silky, opaque glaze.
6.  **Finish:** Return chicken to the pan to coat. Garnish with plenty of fresh parsley.
