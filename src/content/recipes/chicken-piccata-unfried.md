## Chef's Note

We skip the traditional flour dredging to keep this dish light and the flavors clean. The secret to a restaurant-quality piccata without the mess is the **Culinary Technique** of the **Monter au Beurre** (The Butter Mount). By whisking cold butter into the hot lemon broth off the heat, we create a stable, glossy emulsion that clings to the chicken. The capers and lemon provide the mandatory **High Note** finish to cut through the richness.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Pound chicken cutlets to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Season generously with salt and pepper.
2.  **Sear:** Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear chicken for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through. Remove to a plate.
3.  **Aromatics:** Reduce heat to medium. Add garlic and capers to the pan. Sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant.
4.  **Deglaze:** Pour in chicken broth and lemon juice. Scrape the bottom of the pan to release the fond. Simmer for 3 minutes to reduce by a third.
5.  **The Magic:** Turn off the heat. Add the cold butter cubes and whisk vigorously until melted into a silky, opaque glaze.
6.  **Finish:** Return chicken to the pan to coat. Garnish with plenty of fresh parsley.
