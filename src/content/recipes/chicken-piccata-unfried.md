## Description

A lighter, faster take on the classic. We skip the flour dredging to keep the sauce clean and the chicken tender without the heavy breading. The sauce is emulsified with cold butter at the end for a glossy finish.

## Directions

1.  Season chicken cutlets generously with salt and pepper on both sides.
2.  Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear chicken for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through. Remove chicken to a plate.
3.  Reduce heat to medium. Add garlic to the pan and sauté for 30 seconds (do not burn).
4.  Pour in chicken broth and lemon juice, scraping up any browned bits (fond) from the bottom of the pan. Simmer for 3 minutes to reduce slightly.
5.  **The Mount:** Turn off the heat. Add the cold butter cubes and whisk vigorously until melted. This creates a creamy emulsion without cream.
6.  Return chicken to the pan to coat in the sauce. Garnish with parsley.
