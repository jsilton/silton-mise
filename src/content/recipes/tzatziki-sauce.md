## Chef's Note

The secret to thick, creamy Tzatziki is **Squeezing**. Cucumbers are mostly water; if you simply grate them into the yogurt, the sauce will turn into a watery mess within 5 minutes. You must salt the grated cucumber and squeeze it until it is bone-dry. This ensures the sauce stays rich and allows the garlic and lemon to shine.

## Directions

1.  **Grate:** Grate the cucumber (skin on) using the large holes of a box grater.
2.  **Squeeze:** Place the grated cucumber in a clean kitchen towel. Sprinkle with salt. Let sit for 5 minutes, then twist and **squeeze vigorously** until no more water comes out.
3.  **Mix:** In a bowl, combine the squeezed cucumber, yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and dill.
4.  **Chill:** Let sit for at least 15 minutes before serving to let the garlic infuse the yogurt.
