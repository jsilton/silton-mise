## Chef's Note

Brisket is the soul of Jewish-American holiday cooking, the centerpiece of Rosh Hashanah and Passover tables for generations. Eastern European Jews brought their braising traditions to America, where brisket - a tough, inexpensive cut - was one of the few affordable kosher options that could feed a large family. Every Jewish grandmother has her version, passed down through oral tradition with no written recipe. Always slice against the grain - look at the direction of the meat fibers and cut perpendicular to them, or even the longest braise won't make it tender.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F.
2.  **Rub:** Combine salt, pepper, garlic, and oregano. Rub the mixture vigorously over all sides of the brisket.
3.  **Layer:** Place the brisket in a heavy roasting pan. Pile the carrots, celery, onions, and bay leaves on and around the meat.
4.  **Seal:** Pour the tomato juice over everything (it should come 3/4 of the way up the meat). Cover the pan with **two sheets of parchment paper**, then seal tightly with heavy-duty aluminum foil.
5.  **The Braise:** Bake for 3 1/2 hours until the meat is fork-tender.
6.  **The Reduction:** Remove the meat to a cutting board and tent with foil to rest. Place the roasting pan across two burners on the stovetop. Boil the vegetables and sauce over medium-high heat for 20-30 minutes until the sauce is glossy and thick.
7.  **Serve:** Slice the meat **across the grain** (essential for tenderness). Serve drenched in the reduced sauce and surrounded by the "melt-in-your-mouth" onions and carrots.
