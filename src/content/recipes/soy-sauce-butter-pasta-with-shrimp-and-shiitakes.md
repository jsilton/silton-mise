## Chef's Note

This is a masterclass in **Updated Classic** fusion. The secret to its Success is **The Wok-Style Butter Emulsion**: we sauté shallots and shiitakes in butter until caramelized, then deglaze with white wine and soy sauce. This creates a deeply savory complex flavor base. We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Shrimp Snap Method**: we sear the shrimp on high heat and remove them immediately, adding them back only in the final 30 seconds. The cold butter finish provides the mandatory creamy "Bounce."

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water for 1 minute **less** than package directions. **Reserve 1 cup of pasta water**.
2.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet, heat 1 tbsp oil until smoking. Sear shrimp for 1 minute per side until pink. Remove.
3.  **Aromatics:** Add 1 tbsp butter. Sauté shallots and garlic for 2 minutes. Add shiitakes and cook until dark and crispy (5 mins).
4.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the wine. Simmer for 2 minutes until reduced by half.
5.  **Emulsify:** Add the soy sauce and the cold butter. Whisk until a thick, glossy sauce forms.
6.  **Bind:** Add the pasta, shrimp, and 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water. Toss over medium heat for 1 minute until the sauce is creamy.
7.  **Finish:** Stir in the Parmesan and parsley for the mandatory **High Note**. Serve immediately.
