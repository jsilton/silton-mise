## Chef's Note

This fusion dish combines Italian pasta with Japanese-influenced soy butter sauce, creating a style popularized in contemporary Asian-fusion restaurants. The sauce builds from caramelized shiitakes and shallots, deglazed with white wine and soy sauce, then finished with cold butter whisked in to create a rich, glossy emulsion. Shrimp are seared quickly and added at the end to stay tender.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water for 1 minute **less** than package directions. **Reserve 1 cup of pasta water**.
2.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet, heat 1 tbsp oil until smoking. Sear shrimp for 1 minute per side until pink. Remove.
3.  **Aromatics:** Add 1 tbsp butter. Sauté shallots and garlic for 2 minutes. Add shiitakes and cook until dark and crispy (5 mins).
4.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the wine. Simmer for 2 minutes until reduced by half.
5.  **Emulsify:** Add the soy sauce and the cold butter. Whisk until a thick, glossy sauce forms.
6.  **Bind:** Add the pasta, shrimp, and 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water. Toss over medium heat for 1 minute until the sauce is creamy.
7.  **Finish:** Stir in the Parmesan and parsley for the mandatory **High Note**. Serve immediately.
