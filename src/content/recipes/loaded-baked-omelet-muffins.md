## Chef's Note

These are the ultimate "Modularity" component for breakfast prep. The secret to avoiding the rubbery, watery texture of most egg muffins is **Textural Balance** through **The Dry Squeeze Method**: you must squeeze the thawed spinach in a towel until **bone-dry** before adding to the eggs. We use **The Bacon Anchor**: placing the bacon and diced veg at the bottom of the tin ensures they develop a slight Crunch against the metal, providing a savory foundation for the fluffy egg "Bounce."

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray a 12-cup muffin tin generously with oil spray.
2.  **The Base:** Divide the bacon, dry spinach, tomatoes, onions, and peppers evenly among the 12 cups.
3.  **Aeration:** In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, salt, and pepper until very frothy and no streaks remain.
4.  **Assemble:** Pour the egg mixture into the cups, filling each about 3/4 full. Sprinkle the cheese over the tops.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 20-25 minutes until the centers are firm and the tops are slightly golden and puffed.
6.  **Store:** Let cool for 5 minutes before removing. These can be frozen for up to 3 months and reheated in 45 seconds.
