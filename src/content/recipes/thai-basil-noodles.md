## Chef's Note

This is a high-heat, high-speed meal. The key to the Kitchen Standard is the **Acid Balance**: the heavy, salty sauce (Oyster/Fish/Soy) needs the bright lift of fresh lime juice at the very end to make the flavors pop. Don't crowd the wok—cook the meat until it gets crispy edges for maximum texture.

## Directions

1.  **Noodles:** Soak rice noodles in hot water for 15-20 minutes until pliable but still firm (al dente). Drain and set aside.
2.  **Sauce:** Whisk all sauce ingredients in a small bowl.
3.  **Meat:** Heat oil in a wok until smoking. Add the ground meat and spread it flat. Let it sear undisturbed for 2 minutes to get a "crust," then break it up and cook until browned.
4.  **Aromatics:** Add the garlic, chilies, and bell pepper. Stir-fry for 30 seconds until fragrant.
5.  **Toss:** Add the noodles and the sauce. Stir-fry vigorously over high heat, scraping the bottom of the wok, until the noodles absorb the sauce and turn dark brown.
6.  **Wilt:** Add the basil. Toss for 30 seconds until just wilted.
7.  **The Acid Balance:** Turn off the heat. Squeeze half a lime over the noodles and toss.
