## Directions

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil for the noodles. We find that package cooking instructions can be inconsistent, so check the noodles often until they’re al dente (cooked through but still firm and chewy). For our noodles, total cook time was about 5 minutes. Drain them in a colander, and rinse in cold water.
2. Stir together the dissolved brown sugar mixture, Thai thin soy sauce, fish sauce, and oyster sauce in a small bowl.
3. Heat your wok until it’s close to smoking, and spread 2 tablespoons of oil around the perimeter of the wok. Add the garlic, white parts of the scallion, Thai chilies, and bell pepper. Stir-fry for 30 seconds.
4. Add the rice noodles. Use a scooping motion to mix everything for another minute until the noodles warm up.
5. Next, add the prepared sauce mixture and stir-fry at the highest heat for about 1 minute until the noodles are uniform in color. Take care to use your metal spatula to scrape the bottom of the wok to prevent sticking.
6. Add the Thai basil and the green parts of the scallions, and stir-fry just until the leaves are wilted. Serve!
