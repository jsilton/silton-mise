## Chef's Note

This is a true "Traditional Recipe." While a traditional French braise uses wine and mirepoix, the American-Jewish Shabbat brisket relies on the **Ketchup and Grape Jelly** base to create a thick, sweet-and-savory glaze that is unmistakable. The secret to the texture is the **Overnight Chill**: by refrigerating the brisket in its sauce, the meat relaxes and becomes much easier to slice against the grain without falling apart.

## Directions

1.  **Season:** Season the brisket generously with salt and pepper on both sides. Place fat-side up in a heavy foil pan or Dutch oven.
2.  **Vegetables:** Scatter the onions and carrots over and around the meat.
3.  **Sauce:** In a bowl, whisk all sauce ingredients together. Pour over the entire brisket, ensuring it is fully covered. Add 1 cup of water around the edges.
4.  **Bake:** Cover tightly with foil. Bake at 350°F for 1.5 to 2 hours until tender.
5.  **The Chill:** Remove from oven. Let cool, then refrigerate the entire pan **overnight**.
6.  **Slice:** Remove the cold meat from the sauce. Slice very thin **against the grain**.
7.  **Finish:** Return the slices to the sauce. Re-bake, covered, at 325°F for 30-45 minutes until hot and the sauce is bubbling.
