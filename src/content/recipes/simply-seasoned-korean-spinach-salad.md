## Chef's Note

The secret to "Kitchen Standard" Korean spinach is **Culinary Technique** through **The 30-Second Blanch Method**. Spinach is 90% water; by plunging it into boiling water for exactly 30 seconds and then into ice water, we lock in the vibrant green chlorophyll and provide a resilient "Bounce." We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Squeeze**: you must gather the chilled spinach and squeeze until it is a dry, dense ball before seasoning. The toasted sesame oil is the mandatory savory **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Bring a large pot of water to a boil with 1 tsp salt. Prepare an ice-water bath.
2.  **Blanch:** Plunge washed spinach into boiling water. Cook for 30 seconds until just wilted.
3.  **Shock:** Drain immediately and submerge in ice water for 2 minutes.
4.  **The Squeeze:** Squeeze the spinach with your hands until **bone-dry**. No water should remain.
5.  **Cut:** Cut the dry spinach ball into 2-inch sections.
6.  **Bind:** In a large bowl, whisk sesame oil, garlic, salt, and scallions. Add the spinach and toss vigorously with your hands to separate the leaves.
7.  **Finish:** Garnish with sesame seeds. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
