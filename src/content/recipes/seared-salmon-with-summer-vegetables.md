## Chef's Note

Reducing balsamic vinegar and tomatoes into a syrup, then mounting with cold butter cubes whisked in one at a time creates a thick, glossy emulsion—a technique borrowed from French beurre blanc and beurre rouge. The butter must be cold so it emulsifies rather than separating. Searing salmon strips over high heat for 3 minutes per side develops a crisp crust while keeping the center medium-rare and tender.

## Directions

1.  **The Reduction:** In a saucepan, simmer vinegar, tomato, onion, 1 garlic clove, and mushroom stems until reduced to a thick syrup (4 mins).
2.  **Mounting:** Reduce heat to low. Whisk in cold butter cubes, 2 at a time, until the sauce is creamy and opaque. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve and keep warm.
3.  **The Wilt:** Sauté spinach in a hot pan with a fork-pierced garlic clove until collapsed. Drain and set aside.
4.  **The Crunch:** In the same pan, sauté shiitake caps and corn in butter for 6 minutes until charred and tender.
5.  **The Sear:** Season salmon. In a clean skillet, heat 1 tbsp oil until smoking. Sear salmon strips for 3 minutes per side until a crust forms.
6.  **Serve:** Divide spinach among plates. Top with corn, shiitakes, and a salmon strip.
7.  **Finish:** Drizzle the balsamic emulsion over the fish. Garnish with chives for the mandatory **High Note**.
