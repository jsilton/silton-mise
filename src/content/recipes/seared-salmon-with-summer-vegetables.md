## Chef's Note

This is a 40-minute "Project" meal disguised as a "Speed" dinner. The secret to its Success is **The Mounting Pattern (Beurre Rouge)**: we reduce balsamic vinegar and tomatoes into a syrupy base, then whisk in **cold butter** one cube at a time. This creates a thick, mirror-glossy emulsion with a velvet "Bounce" that standard sauces lack. We maintain **Texture Integrity** by searing the salmon strips on high heat for exactly 3 minutes per side to develop a "Snap" crust while keeping the center medium-rare.

## Directions

1.  **The Reduction:** In a saucepan, simmer vinegar, tomato, onion, 1 garlic clove, and mushroom stems until reduced to a thick syrup (4 mins).
2.  **Mounting:** Reduce heat to low. Whisk in cold butter cubes, 2 at a time, until the sauce is creamy and opaque. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve and keep warm.
3.  **The Wilt:** Sauté spinach in a hot pan with a fork-pierced garlic clove until collapsed. Drain and set aside.
4.  **The Snap:** In the same pan, sauté shiitake caps and corn in butter for 6 minutes until charred and tender.
5.  **The Sear:** Season salmon. In a clean skillet, heat 1 tbsp oil until smoking. Sear salmon strips for 3 minutes per side until a crust forms.
6.  **Serve:** Divide spinach among plates. Top with corn, shiitakes, and a salmon strip.
7.  **Finish:** Drizzle the balsamic emulsion over the fish. Garnish with chives for the mandatory **High Note**.
