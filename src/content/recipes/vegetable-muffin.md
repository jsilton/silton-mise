## Chef's Note
These are high-performance **Modularity** components for busy families. The secret to their Success is **Structural Science** through **The High-Speed Emulsion**. You must pulverize the raw greens and wet ingredients in a blender until they form a perfectly smooth, neon-green liquid. This ensures the moisture is evenly distributed, resulting in a cake-like "Bounce" that masks the fibrous greens. The addition of **Apple Cider Vinegar** is the mandatory **Acid Finish** needed to activate the baking soda for a tall rise.

## Directions

1.  **Emulsify:** In a high-powered blender, combine eggs, banana, spinach, syrup, oil, and vinegar. Blend on high for 60 seconds until vibrant green.
2.  **Dry Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt.
3.  **Combine:** Pour the green emulsion into the dry ingredients. Stir with a spatula until **just mixed**. Fold in the chocolate chips.
4.  **Bake:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a 12-cup tin. Fill each 3/4 full. Bake for 20-22 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean.
5.  **Cool:** Let rest in the pan for 5 minutes. These freeze perfectly for up to 3 months.
