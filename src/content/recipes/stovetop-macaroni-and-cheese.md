## Chef's Note

The secret to "Gold Standard" stovetop mac is **Structural Science** through **The Steam-Whisk Pattern**. Instead of making a traditional butter roux, we whisk the flour into **cold milk** and then heat it; this creates a light, stable base that has a velvety "Bounce" and won't separate when the cheese is added. We maintain **Texture Integrity** by boiling the pasta for exactly 8 minutes (very al dente) to ensure it holds its shape against the heavy cheese. The mustard powder provides the mandatory savory **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water for 8 minutes until **very al dente**. Drain and set aside.
2.  **The Base:** In a large saucepan, whisk together 1/2 cup of the milk and the flour until no lumps remain. Stir in the remaining 1 cup of milk.
3.  **Thicken:** Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, for 3-4 minutes until the milk thickens to the consistency of heavy cream.
4.  **Emulsify:** Reduce heat to **low**. Add the cheese one handful at a time, stirring until completely molten and glossy.
5.  **Season:** Stir in the salt, mustard powder, and butter.
6.  **Bind:** Return the hot pasta to the saucepan. Toss vigorously until every noodle is saturated in the cheese silk.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately while hot. (Note: if baking, top with breadcrumbs and broil for 2 minutes).
