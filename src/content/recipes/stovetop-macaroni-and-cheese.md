## Chef's Note

Whisking flour into cold milk before heating creates a light, stable base that won't separate when cheese is added—an easier technique than making a traditional butter roux. Boiling pasta for exactly 8 minutes (very al dente) ensures it holds its shape against the heavy cheese sauce instead of turning mushy. Mustard powder adds savory depth that enhances the sharp cheddar without tasting overtly mustardy.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water for 8 minutes until **very al dente**. Drain and set aside.
2.  **The Base:** In a large saucepan, whisk together 1/2 cup of the milk and the flour until no lumps remain. Stir in the remaining 1 cup of milk.
3.  **Thicken:** Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, for 3-4 minutes until the milk thickens to the consistency of heavy cream.
4.  **Emulsify:** Reduce heat to **low**. Add the cheese one handful at a time, stirring until completely molten and glossy.
5.  **Season:** Stir in the salt, mustard powder, and butter.
6.  **Bind:** Return the hot pasta to the saucepan. Toss vigorously until every noodle is saturated in the cheese silk.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately while hot. (Note: if baking, top with breadcrumbs and broil for 2 minutes).
