## Chef's Note

The secret to great Yaki Udon is maintaining texture. Frozen udon has a superior chew (mochi-mochi) compared to shelf-stable versions. We sear the meat and veggies separately over high heat so they stay crunchy and charred, rather than steaming together into a mushy pile.

## Directions

1.  **Noodles:** Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add frozen udon. As soon as the noodles separate (about 1 minute), drain them. **Do not overcook.** Rinse with cold water and toss with a drop of sesame oil.
2.  **Protein:** Heat a wok over high heat. Add oil and sear the meat until browned and crispy. Remove to a plate.
3.  **Veggies:** Add another splash of oil. Sauté mushrooms and carrots for 2 minutes. Add the bok choy stems. Sauté for 1 minute until they have charred edges but are still snappy.
4.  **Combine:** Add the noodles and the seared meat back to the wok.
5.  **Sauce:** Pour in the whisked sauce ingredients. Toss vigorously over high heat for 2 minutes until the sauce coats every noodle and turns glossy.
6.  **Finish:** Add the bok choy leaves at the very end. Serve hot with a sprinkle of Furikake or chili oil.
