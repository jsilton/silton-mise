## Chef's Note

The secret to this vegetable puree is sweating the vegetables gently. You must sauté the zucchini and onions in a mix of butter and oil on very low heat; this allows the sugars to develop without any browning, resulting in a vibrant green color and a naturally sweet flavor. We get textural contrast by blending the soup until perfectly velvety, then finishing with paper-thin julienned raw zucchini for a fresh, crisp garnish.

## Directions

1.  **The Sweat:** In a large pot, melt butter and oil. Add onion and garlic. Sauté over low heat for 8 minutes until translucent but not brown.
2.  **Stage 2:** Add zucchini rounds. Sauté for 10 minutes until soft.
3.  **Simmer:** Pour in the stock and water. Season with salt and white pepper. Bring to a gentle boil, then simmer for 10 minutes.
4.  **The Emulsion:** Working in two batches, transfer to a high-speed blender. Puree until the soup is completely smooth and glossy.
5.  **Finish:** Stir in the lemon juice for the mandatory **Acid Balance**.
6.  **Serve:** Ladle into bowls. Top with the julienned raw zucchini and a drizzle of olive oil for the final **High Note**.
