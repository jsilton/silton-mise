## Directions

1. Cut your salmon into 1 inch cubes. I took the skin off, but you can keep it on if you prefer.
2. Whisk together all ingredients for the marinade in a large bowl.
3. Add in the salmon and marinate for up to 1 hour, but ideally at least 20 minutes.
4. Once it's done marinating, heat a large skillet with a splash of oil and add in the salmon, but keep the rest of the marinade on the side for now.
5. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side to get a nice crisp.
6. Add in the marinade and cook until the sauce thickens.
7. Assemble your bowls with a bed of rice, then add in the salmon, avocado, cucumber, edamame and top with the sriracha mayo.
8. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes and sesame seeds and enjoy!
