## Chef's Note

Asian-inspired grain bowls with glazed proteins became hugely popular in the 2010s. Cutting salmon into cubes and searing them creates crispy, spicy edges while keeping the inside tender. The honey-sriracha marinade doubles as the glaze—reduce it in the hot pan after searing for a thick, syrupy coating. Build bowls with rice, cucumber salad, avocado, and edamame for a balanced, flavorful meal.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** Whisk soy sauce, honey, sriracha, and garlic. Toss with salmon cubes. Let sit for 15-20 minutes.
2.  **The Sear:** Heat a large non-stick or cast-iron skillet over high heat with a splash of oil. Drain salmon from marinade (reserve it!).
3.  **Crisp:** Add salmon in a single layer. Cook for 2-3 minutes without moving until a crust forms. Flip and cook for 1 minute. Remove to a plate.
4.  **The Glaze:** Pour the reserved marinade into the hot pan. Let it bubble and reduce for 1-2 minutes until thick and syrupy. Toss the salmon back in to coat.
5.  **Assemble:** Build bowls with a base of [Jasmine Rice](/silton-mise/recipes/homemade-rice-pilaf). Top with salmon, avocado, edamame, and cucumber salad.
6.  **Finish:** Drizzle with sriracha mayo and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
