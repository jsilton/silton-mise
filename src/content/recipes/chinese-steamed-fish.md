## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate test of **Culinary Technique** in Cantonese cuisine. The secret is the **Sizzling Oil Finish**: we pour smoking-hot oil directly over the raw ginger and scallions sitting atop the steamed fish. This "flash-cooks" the aromatics, releasing their oils into the skin of the fish and creating a fragrance that is unattainable through steaming alone. Always discard the "fish water" from the steaming plate—it carries the muddy off-flavors we want to avoid.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Clean and scale the fish. Pat it **bone-dry**. Whisk the seasoning sauce ingredients in a small bowl until the sugar dissolves.
2.  **Steam Prep:** Drizzle 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine over the fish. Top with half of the ginger strips.
3.  **Steam:** Place the fish in a steamer (or on a plate propped up in a wok). Steam over high heat for 8-10 minutes until the flesh just flakes at the thickest part.
4.  **Drain:** Carefully remove the plate. **Discard the liquid** that has collected on the plate—this is critical for a clean flavor.
5.  **Aromatics:** Top the hot fish with the remaining ginger and the scallion threads.
6.  **The Sizzle:** Heat 2 tbsp oil in a small pan until it is smoking. Carefully pour the hot oil directly over the scallions and ginger. You should hear a loud sizzle.
7.  **Season:** Pour the seasoning sauce into the same hot oil pan, let it bubble for 5 seconds, then pour it over the fish.
8.  **Serve:** Garnish with cilantro and serve immediately with white rice.
