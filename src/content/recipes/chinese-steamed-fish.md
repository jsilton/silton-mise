## Chef's Note

Steamed whole fish is a cornerstone of Cantonese cuisine, showcasing the fish's natural flavor. The finishing touch: pour smoking-hot oil over raw ginger and scallions on top of the cooked fish. This flash-cooks the aromatics and releases their fragrant oils directly into the fish. Always discard the liquid that collects on the steaming plate—it contains off-flavors from the fish. Use the freshest fish possible, ideally snapper or sea bass.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Clean and scale the fish. Pat it **bone-dry**. Whisk the seasoning sauce ingredients in a small bowl until the sugar dissolves.
2.  **Steam Prep:** Drizzle 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine over the fish. Top with half of the ginger strips.
3.  **Steam:** Place the fish in a steamer (or on a plate propped up in a wok). Steam over high heat for 8-10 minutes until the flesh just flakes at the thickest part.
4.  **Drain:** Carefully remove the plate. **Discard the liquid** that has collected on the plate—this is critical for a clean flavor.
5.  **Aromatics:** Top the hot fish with the remaining ginger and the scallion threads.
6.  **The Sizzle:** Heat 2 tbsp oil in a small pan until it is smoking. Carefully pour the hot oil directly over the scallions and ginger. You should hear a loud sizzle.
7.  **Season:** Pour the seasoning sauce into the same hot oil pan, let it bubble for 5 seconds, then pour it over the fish.
8.  **Serve:** Garnish with cilantro and serve immediately with white rice.
