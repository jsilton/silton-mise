## Chef's Note

Cantonese steamed fish is a classic from Guangdong province, prized for its delicate simplicity. The fish is steamed with ginger to infuse flavor, then the real magic happens: smoking-hot oil is poured over raw scallions and cilantro on top of the fish. This flash-cooks the herbs and releases their aromatics directly into the fish. Light soy sauce with a touch of sugar balances the seasoning perfectly.

## Directions

1.  **Steam:** Place the fish on a heat-proof plate. Scatter half the ginger on top. Steam over boiling water for 8-10 minutes until the fish flakes easily.
2.  **Drain:** Carefully pour off any excess liquid from the plate (this liquid can be "fishy").
3.  **Layer:** Arrange the remaining ginger, scallion greens, and cilantro in a pile on top of the cooked fish.
4.  **The Sauce:** Whisk the soy sauce and sugar. Pour it around the base of the fish.
5.  **The Sizzle:** In a small saucepan, heat the oil until it is literally smoking.
6.  **Finish:** Carefully pour the hot oil directly over the herbs and ginger. It should sizzle loudly. Serve immediately.
