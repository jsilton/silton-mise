## Chef's Note

Pad kee mao ('drunken noodles') is a Thai stir-fry known for its bold, spicy flavors and charred edges. Velveting the chicken in cornstarch and water keeps it tender during high-heat cooking. Wide rice noodles are scraped vigorously with a metal spatula during the final toss to create slightly charred, chewy edges and prevent sticking - the hallmark of good wok hei (breath of the wok).

## Directions

1.  **Velvet:** Work water into chicken until absorbed. Toss with cornstarch, oil, and soy sauce. Let sit for 20 minutes.
2.  **Noodles:** Soak rice noodles in hot tap water for 20 minutes (or flash-boil) until **al dente**. Rinse in cold water and drain.
3.  **The Sauce:** Whisk together all Kee Mao sauce ingredients. Set aside.
4.  **The Sear:** Heat wok until smoking. Spread 2 tbsp oil around the perimeter. Sear chicken for 1 minute per side until 90% cooked. Remove chicken and set aside.
5.  **Aromatics:** Add 1 tbsp oil, garlic, and ginger. Sauté for 10 seconds. Add shallots, scallions, chilies, basil, and baby corn. Splash the Shaoxing wine around the rim.
6.  **Toss:** Add the noodles. Use a "scooping" motion to mix for 1 minute until warmed through.
7.  **Bind:** Pour in the sauce. Stir-fry at **MAXIMUM HEAT** for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking, until noodles are uniform in color.
8.  **Finish:** Return chicken to the wok. Toss for 1 more minute until glossy. Serve immediately.
