## Chef's Note

The secret to authentic pad kee mao is **Culinary Technique** through **Velveting**. By working water and cornstarch into the chicken, we ensure it stays succulent even at the "Highest Heat" needed for the noodles. We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Scrape Method**: wide rice noodles tend to stick and tear; you must use a metal spatula to scrape the bottom of the wok aggressively during the final sauce reduction to create those slightly charred, chewy edges known as "Wok Hei."

## Directions

1.  **Velvet:** Work water into chicken until absorbed. Toss with cornstarch, oil, and soy sauce. Let sit for 20 minutes.
2.  **Noodles:** Soak rice noodles in hot tap water for 20 minutes (or flash-boil) until **al dente**. Rinse in cold water and drain.
3.  **The Sauce:** Whisk together all Kee Mao sauce ingredients. Set aside.
4.  **The Sear:** Heat wok until smoking. Spread 2 tbsp oil around the perimeter. Sear chicken for 1 minute per side until 90% cooked. Remove chicken and set aside.
5.  **Aromatics:** Add 1 tbsp oil, garlic, and ginger. Sauté for 10 seconds. Add shallots, scallions, chilies, basil, and baby corn. Splash the Shaoxing wine around the rim.
6.  **Toss:** Add the noodles. Use a "scooping" motion to mix for 1 minute until warmed through.
7.  **Bind:** Pour in the sauce. Stir-fry at **MAXIMUM HEAT** for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking, until noodles are uniform in color.
8.  **Finish:** Return chicken to the wok. Toss for 1 more minute until glossy. Serve immediately.
