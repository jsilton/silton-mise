## Chef's Note

The Vieux Carré is a New Orleans masterpiece that demands **Precision and Diligence**. Unlike a citrus-based cocktail, this is a spirit-forward drink that must be **STIRRED, NEVER SHAKEN**. Shaking introduces air bubbles and ice shards that ruin the silky, viscous mouthfeel of the Cognac and Vermouth. We stir for a full 30 seconds to achieve perfect dilution and a crystal-clear appearance.

## Directions

1.  **Chill:** Place your rocks glass or coupe in the freezer for 5 minutes.
2.  **Combine:** In a mixing glass filled with large, clean ice cubes, combine the rye, cognac, vermouth, Benedictine, and both bitters.
3.  **Stir:** Stir gently with a long barspoon for **30 seconds**. You want the liquid to be ice cold and slightly diluted.
4.  **Strain:** Strain into the chilled glass over one large clear ice cube (or neat).
5.  **Express:** Squeeze the lemon twist over the surface of the drink to release the oils, then drop it in.
