## Chef's Note

The secret to fritters that aren't a soggy mess is **Culinary Technique** through **The Ice-Shock Squeeze Method**. You must grate the zucchini and potato, salt them heavily, and let them sit for 30 minutes. Then, wrap them in a kitchen towel and **squeeze with maximum force** until bone-dry. This ensures the fritters have a resilient Texture while the exterior develops a shatteringly crisp Crunch in the oil. The garlic yogurt provides the mandatory **Acid Balance** to cut the deep-fried richness.

## Directions

1.  **The Squeeze:** Grate zucchini, potato, and onion. Toss with 2 tsp salt. Let stand in a sieve for 30 minutes. **Squeeze in a towel until no juice remains**.
2.  **The Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk eggs, garlic, cumin, and all fresh herbs.
3.  **Bind:** Add the dry vegetables to the eggs. Sprinkle the flour and baking powder over the top. Mix gently until a thick, sticky batter forms.
4.  **The Crunch:** Heat 1/2-inch of neutral oil in a large skillet.
5.  **Fry:** Drop 1/4-cup scoops into the hot oil. Flatten with a spatula. Fry for 3 minutes per side until deep golden brown.
6.  **Drain:** Transfer to a wire rack (The Air-Snap Method) to keep the bottom crispy.
7.  **Serve:** Whisk yogurt ingredients. Serve the warm fritters with a dollop of cold garlic yogurt.
