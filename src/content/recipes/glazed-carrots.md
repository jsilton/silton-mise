## Chef's Note

Par-boil carrots in minimal water, then drain and return to the hot pan. Melt butter and sugar directly in the warm pan to create a thick emulsion that clings to carrots - the French call this "monter au beurre" (mounting with butter). White pepper adds complexity without overwhelming sweetness.

## Directions

1.  **Par-Boil:** Place carrot sticks in a large saucepan. Add 1 inch of salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer for 8-10 minutes until tender but still having a slight "Snap."
2.  **Drain:** Drain the carrots and transfer to a bowl. **Do not rinse.**
3.  **The Emulsion:** In the same warm saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Whisk in the brown sugar, salt, and white pepper until the sugar is completely dissolved and the mixture is bubbling.
4.  **Glaze:** Return the carrots to the pan. Toss vigorously over medium heat for 2-3 minutes until the carrots are perfectly coated in a glossy, thick glaze.
5.  **Finish:** Stir in fresh thyme if using. Serve immediately.
