## Chef's Note

The secret to "Kitchen Standard" glazed carrots is **Culinary Technique** through **The Monter au Beurre Method** (The Butter Mount). Instead of just boiling carrots in sugar water, we par-boil them in just 1 inch of water, drain, and then mount the butter and sugar into the hot pan. This creates a thick, velvet-like emulsion that clings to the **Stick Cut** carrots rather than pooling at the bottom. The **White Pepper** is the mandatory "High Note" that prevents the glaze from being one-dimensional.

## Directions

1.  **Par-Boil:** Place carrot sticks in a large saucepan. Add 1 inch of salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer for 8-10 minutes until tender but still having a slight "Snap."
2.  **Drain:** Drain the carrots and transfer to a bowl. **Do not rinse.**
3.  **The Emulsion:** In the same warm saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Whisk in the brown sugar, salt, and white pepper until the sugar is completely dissolved and the mixture is bubbling.
4.  **Glaze:** Return the carrots to the pan. Toss vigorously over medium heat for 2-3 minutes until the carrots are perfectly coated in a glossy, thick glaze.
5.  **Finish:** Stir in fresh thyme if using. Serve immediately.
