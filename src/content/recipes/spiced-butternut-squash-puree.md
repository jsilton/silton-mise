## Chef's Note

We have evolved this family tradition from boiling to roasting. Boiling the squash dilutes its natural sugars with water; roasting at high heat evaporates moisture and triggers the Maillard reaction, concentrating the squash into a deeper, sweeter version of itself. This is our classic Thanksgiving side.

## Directions

1.  **Roast:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss the squash cubes with olive oil and a pinch of salt on a large baking sheet. Spread in a single layer. Roast for 30-40 minutes until tender and starting to caramelize at the edges.
2.  **Purée:** Transfer the hot, roasted squash to a large bowl (or food processor for a silkier texture).
3.  **Mash:** Add the room-temperature butter and mash/process until smooth.
4.  **Season:** Stir in the sugar, maple syrup, nutmeg, and black pepper.
5.  **Finish:** If needed, transfer to a saucepan over low heat to serve piping hot. Taste and adjust salt or sweetness as desired.
