## Chef's Note

Traditional latkes rely on starch; sweet potato latkes rely on **Texture Integrity** through **The Hand-Press Pattern**. You must squeeze the grated potatoes in a kitchen towel until they are **bone-dry** before mixing with the eggs; this ensures the latke sets into a firm "Bounce" rather than falling apart in the pan. We maintain **The Sizzle Pattern**: frying in 1/2-inch of hot oil creates a deep, lattice-like "Snap" on the exterior that mimics the best diner-style hash browns. The scallions provide the mandatory savory **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **The Squeeze:** Grate the potatoes. Wrap in a clean kitchen towel and **squeeze with maximum force** until no more juice drips out. Place in a bowl.
2.  **The Bind:** Stir in the scallions, flour, salt, and pepper. Add the eggs and mix until a tacky, thick batter forms.
3.  **Thermal Prep:** Heat oil in a heavy 12-inch skillet over medium-high until shimmering but not smoking.
4.  **The Snap:** Spoon 1/8-cup portions into the oil. Use a spatula to flatten them into 3-inch disks.
5.  **Fry:** Cook for 2 minutes per side until the edges are deep golden and the center is set. Do not crowd the pan (4 latkes per batch).
6.  **Drain:** Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. Season with a final pinch of salt while hot.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with [Nana Ruth's Applesauce](/recipes/nana-ruths-applesauce).
