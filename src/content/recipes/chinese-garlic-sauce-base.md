## Chef's Note

This is the foundation sauce for countless Chinese-American stir-fries. It balances sweet, salty, sour, and umami while the cornstarch creates that restaurant-quality glossy coating. Mix it ahead and pour it into your hot wok at the end of cooking—stir constantly for 30-60 seconds until it bubbles and turns from cloudy to clear. Use it for any "garlic sauce" dish with eggplant, broccoli, green beans, or protein.

## Directions

1.  **Whisk:** In a small bowl or jar, combine all ingredients. Whisk vigorously until the cornstarch is completely dissolved.
2.  **Use:** Pour into a hot wok at the very end of cooking. Stir constantly for 30-60 seconds until the sauce bubbles and turns from cloudy to clear and glossy.
