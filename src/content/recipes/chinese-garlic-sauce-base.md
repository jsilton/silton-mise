## Chef's Note

This is the "Mother Sauce" of the Chinese-American kitchen. It balances the five essential flavors and has enough starch to create a glossy, restaurant-quality glaze instantly. Use it for eggplant, broccoli, or any "Garlic Sauce" stir-fry.

## Directions

1.  **Whisk:** In a small bowl or jar, combine all ingredients. Whisk vigorously until the cornstarch is completely dissolved.
2.  **Use:** Pour into a hot wok at the very end of cooking. Stir constantly for 30-60 seconds until the sauce bubbles and turns from cloudy to clear and glossy.
