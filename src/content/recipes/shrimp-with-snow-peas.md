## Chef's Note

This is a classic Cantonese "Clean" stir-fry. To achieve the "Restaurant Snap," we use two professional techniques: **The Alkaline Rinse** (baking soda) which gives the shrimp a bouncy texture, and **Velveting** (cornstarch/wine marinade) which protects the delicate protein from the high heat of the wok. This results in shrimp that are juicy and translucent, paired with snow peas that are vivid green and crisp.

## Directions

1.  **The Crunch:** Toss the shrimp with the baking soda and a splash of cold water. Let sit for 5 minutes, then **rinse thoroughly** under cold running water. Pat bone-dry.
2.  **Velvet:** Toss the dry shrimp with the cornstarch, salt, and 1 tsp Shaoxing wine. Let sit while you prep the rest.
3.  **The Sauce:** Whisk all sauce ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
4.  **The Sear:** Heat your wok or heavy skillet until smoking hot. Add 1 tbsp oil. Stir-fry the snow peas for 45-60 seconds until they turn bright green and have a few charred spots. Remove to a plate.
5.  **The Shrimp:** Add another tbsp of oil. Spread the shrimp out in a single layer. Let them sear undisturbed for 1 minute to get a golden crust. Flip and cook for 30 seconds.
6.  **Aromatics:** Add the ginger, garlic, and green onions. Toss with the shrimp for 30 seconds until fragrant.
7.  **Finish:** Stir the sauce one last time and pour it into the pan. Toss everything together for 30-60 seconds until the sauce bubbles and turns into a clear, glossy glaze.
8.  **Serve:** Serve immediately over [Jasmine Rice](/silton-mise/recipes/homemade-rice-pilaf).
