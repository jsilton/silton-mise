## Chef's Note

This classic Cantonese stir-fry showcases delicate proteins and spring vegetables with minimal sauce. Treating shrimp with baking soda creates a firm, snappy texture, while a cornstarch and Shaoxing wine marinade (velveting) keeps them tender under high heat. The result is juicy, translucent shrimp paired with crisp, bright green snow peas.

## Directions

1.  **The Crunch:** Toss the shrimp with the baking soda and a splash of cold water. Let sit for 5 minutes, then **rinse thoroughly** under cold running water. Pat bone-dry.
2.  **Velvet:** Toss the dry shrimp with the cornstarch, salt, and 1 tsp Shaoxing wine. Let sit while you prep the rest.
3.  **The Sauce:** Whisk all sauce ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
4.  **The Sear:** Heat your wok or heavy skillet until smoking hot. Add 1 tbsp oil. Stir-fry the snow peas for 45-60 seconds until they turn bright green and have a few charred spots. Remove to a plate.
5.  **The Shrimp:** Add another tbsp of oil. Spread the shrimp out in a single layer. Let them sear undisturbed for 1 minute to get a golden crust. Flip and cook for 30 seconds.
6.  **Aromatics:** Add the ginger, garlic, and green onions. Toss with the shrimp for 30 seconds until fragrant.
7.  **Finish:** Stir the sauce one last time and pour it into the pan. Toss everything together for 30-60 seconds until the sauce bubbles and turns into a clear, glossy glaze.
8.  **Serve:** Serve immediately over [Jasmine Rice](/silton-mise/recipes/homemade-rice-pilaf).
