## Chef's Note

This is a **Updated Classic** update to a Family Kitchen holiday staple. We have replaced the legacy margarine with **Unsalted Butter** to provide a richer, cleaner fat profile. The secret to the Kitchen Standard here is **The Nut Toast Method**: for the most elite flavor, toast your pecans in a dry pan for 3 minutes before adding them to the filling—this creates a smoky Crunch that balances the intense sweetness of the Karo syrup.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Place the unbaked pie shells on a baking sheet.
2.  **The Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, Karo syrup, and slightly beaten eggs until well combined.
3.  **The Emulsion:** Slowly whisk in the melted butter, vanilla, and salt until the filling is glossy and uniform.
4.  **Layer:** Divide the pecans evenly between the two pie shells. Pour the syrup mixture over the pecans—they will naturally float to the top to create the Crunch layer.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 40-45 minutes until the edges are set and the center has a slight, stable wobble (the Texture).
6.  **Cool:** Let cool completely (at least 2 hours) before slicing. This is mandatory for the structure to set.
