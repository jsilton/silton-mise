## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate holiday **Project**. The secret to its Success is **Textural Balance** through **The Dehydrated Tomato Method**: you must roast the sliced heirloom tomatoes at 425°F for 40 minutes _before_ adding them to the tart. This concentrates their flavor into a Crunch tender consistency and prevents the bottom crust from turning into a soggy mess. We use **Culinary Technique** for the crust: the addition of **Cider Vinegar** provides a mandatory **Acid Balance** that inhibits gluten development, resulting in a tart shell that is "Shatteringly Soft."

## Directions

1.  **The Crust:** In a food processor, pulse flour, butter, and thyme until pea-sized. Add vinegar and ice water; pulse until a ball forms. Wrap and **refrigerate for 30 minutes**.
2.  **The Roast:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Arrange tomato slices on a pan. Drizzle with oil and salt. Roast for 30-45 minutes until shrunk and dry to the touch. Remove.
3.  **Thermal Prep:** Roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Press into an 11-inch tart pan. **Freeze for 20 minutes** (mandatory for structure).
4.  **Blind Bake:** Line crust with parchment and weights. Bake at 450°F for 20 minutes. Remove weights; bake 5 more mins.
5.  **The Emulsion:** Whisk ricotta, garlic, thyme, and goat cheese until smooth. Spread evenly over the bottom of the crust.
6.  **Assemble:** Layer the roasted tomatoes in a beautiful overlapping pattern over the cheese.
7.  **Final Bake:** Bake at 425°F for 20 minutes until the crust is mahogany brown.
8.  **Serve:** Garnish with fresh purple and green basil for the aromatic **High Note**.
