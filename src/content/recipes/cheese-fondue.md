## Chef's Note

Cheese fondue is a fragile **Emulsion**. If the heat is too high, the cheese will "break" into a stringy ball and a pool of oil. The secret is the **Cornstarch and Acid**: the cornstarch coats the cheese proteins, while the acid in the wine and lemon juice prevents the proteins from clumping together. Always add the cheese in small handfuls, waiting for each to melt before adding the next.

## Directions

1.  **Rub:** Rub the inside of a heavy pot (ceramic or cast iron) with the garlic halves. Discard the garlic.
2.  **Coat:** In a bowl, toss the shredded cheeses with the cornstarch until evenly coated.
3.  **Simmer:** Add the wine and lemon juice to the pot. Bring to a very gentle simmer over medium-low heat.
4.  **Whisk:** Add one handful of cheese. Whisk constantly in a **Figure-8 motion** until melted. Repeat until all cheese is incorporated and the sauce is smooth.
5.  **Finish:** Stir in the Kirsch, nutmeg, and dry mustard.
6.  **Serve:** Keep warm over a low flame. Serve with crusty bread, green apples, and blanched broccoli.
