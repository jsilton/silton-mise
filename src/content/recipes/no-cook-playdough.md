## Chef's Note

While not edible, this is a baseline **Modularity** component for family productivity. The secret to a playdough that isn't sticky and has a professional Texture is **Culinary Technique** through **The Cream of Tartar Method**. The acid in the cream of tartar acts as a preservative and a gluten-stiffener, ensuring the dough remains soft and pliable for months. We use **The Boiling Water Method** to instantly gelatinize the flour starch, eliminating the need for stovetop cooking.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and cream of tartar until perfectly combined.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a separate heatproof jug, mix the boiling water and vegetable oil. If using one color for the whole batch, add the coloring to the liquid now.
3.  **Combine:** Slowly pour the liquid into the dry ingredients. Stir with a large spoon until a shaggy dough forms.
4.  **Knead:** Once cool enough to handle, dump the dough onto a clean surface. Knead vigorously for 2-3 minutes until it becomes completely smooth, elastic, and non-sticky.
5.  **Finish:** If you want multiple colors, divide the white dough and knead the colors into each portion separately.
6.  **Store:** Keep in an airtight container or a zip-top bag to maintain the "Bounce."
