## Chef's Note

This is a high-performance "Fuel" meal that relies on **Texture Integrity**. The secret is **The Charred Kernel Pattern**: we grill the corn whole until the kernels are slightly blackened and "pop" with sweetness, then shear them off the cob. This provides a smoky contrast to the **Herbed Salsa**, which we build using **The Emulsion Pattern**—blending fresh mint and basil with lemon and Parmesan. The lemon provides the mandatory **Acid Finish** that cuts through the rich fat of the chicken thighs.

## Directions

1.  **The Chicken:** Preheat grill to medium-high. Season chicken thighs generously with salt and pepper. Grill, skin-side down first, for 15-20 minutes total, turning once, until the skin is crispy and internal temp reaches 165°F.
2.  **The Corn:** Place corn ears directly on the grill. Cook for 10 minutes, rotating occasionally, until charred in spots.
3.  **The Salsa:** While grilling, place basil, mint, Parmesan, and garlic in a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped. Drizzle in the lemon juice and olive oil and pulse once more until a chunky emulsion forms.
4.  **Combine:** Shear the charred kernels off the cobs. In a small bowl, toss the kernels with the herb sauce.
5.  **Serve:** Place grilled chicken on a platter and top generously with the herbed corn salsa. Serve immediately.
