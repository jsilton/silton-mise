## Chef's Note

This Mexican-inspired grilled chicken showcases summer corn charred directly on the grill until the kernels develop smoky, caramelized spots. The herb salsa combines fresh basil and mint with lemon and Parmesan, creating a bright, aromatic topping. The lemon's acidity cuts through the rich fat of chicken thighs.

## Directions

1.  **The Chicken:** Preheat grill to medium-high. Season chicken thighs generously with salt and pepper. Grill, skin-side down first, for 15-20 minutes total, turning once, until the skin is crispy and internal temp reaches 165°F.
2.  **The Corn:** Place corn ears directly on the grill. Cook for 10 minutes, rotating occasionally, until charred in spots.
3.  **The Salsa:** While grilling, place basil, mint, Parmesan, and garlic in a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped. Drizzle in the lemon juice and olive oil and pulse once more until a chunky emulsion forms.
4.  **Combine:** Shear the charred kernels off the cobs. In a small bowl, toss the kernels with the herb sauce.
5.  **Serve:** Place grilled chicken on a platter and top generously with the herbed corn salsa. Serve immediately.
