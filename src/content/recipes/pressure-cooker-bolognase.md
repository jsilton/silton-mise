## Chef's Note

Ragù alla Bolognese originated in Bologna in the late 18th century as a slow-cooked meat sauce. The official recipe registered with the Bologna Chamber of Commerce in 1982 specifies a soffritto base (onion, celery, carrot), ground beef, pancetta, tomato paste, wine, and milk or cream - simmered for hours until thick and meaty. This pressure cooker version shortcuts the time while maintaining depth by developing a dark fond (browned bits) when searing the meat, then deglazing with red wine to extract those flavors. Use San Marzano tomatoes if possible - they're less acidic and sweeter than regular canned tomatoes. The balsamic vinegar at the end is not traditional but adds complexity.

## Directions

1.  **The Sear:** Set pressure cooker to "Sauté" (High). Brown the pork pieces in olive oil (5 mins); remove. Brown the crumbled sausage; remove.
2.  **The Base:** Add onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté for 5 minutes until soft. Add garlic and bay leaf; cook for 2 minutes.
3.  **The Bloom:** Stir in the tomato paste. Cook for 2 minutes until it turns a deep brick-red.
4.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the wine. Scrape the bottom of the pot vigorously to release the fond. Simmer for 2 minutes.
5.  **Pressure:** Return the meat to the pot. Add the crushed tomatoes. Secure the lid. Set to **High Pressure for 45 minutes**.
6.  **Reduce:** Perform a "Natural Release." Open the lid and set back to "Sauté." Simmer for 15-20 minutes until the sauce is thick and meaty.
7.  **Finish:** Stir in the fresh basil and balsamic vinegar. Taste and adjust with salt and pepper.
8.  **Serve:** Serve over [Fresh Egg Pasta](/silton-mise/recipes/fresh-egg-pasta) with plenty of Parmesan.
