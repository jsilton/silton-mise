## Chef's Note

This is the definitive "Gold Standard" for a weekday ragù. The secret to its elite depth is **Structural Science** through **The Maillard Extraction Pattern**: we sear the meat and sausage separately first to develop a heavy fond, then use the red wine to deglaze the pot. The pressure cooker accelerates the **Collagen Breakdown**, giving the sauce a rich "Bounce" usually only found in 6-hour simmered versions. We finish with **Balsamic Vinegar**—the mandatory **Acid Finish** that cuts through the rich pork fat.

## Directions

1.  **The Sear:** Set pressure cooker to "Sauté" (High). Brown the pork pieces in olive oil (5 mins); remove. Brown the crumbled sausage; remove.
2.  **The Base:** Add onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté for 5 minutes until soft. Add garlic and bay leaf; cook for 2 minutes.
3.  **The Bloom:** Stir in the tomato paste. Cook for 2 minutes until it turns a deep brick-red.
4.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the wine. Scrape the bottom of the pot vigorously to release the fond. Simmer for 2 minutes.
5.  **Pressure:** Return the meat to the pot. Add the crushed tomatoes. Secure the lid. Set to **High Pressure for 45 minutes**.
6.  **Reduce:** Perform a "Natural Release." Open the lid and set back to "Sauté." Simmer for 15-20 minutes until the sauce is thick and meaty.
7.  **Finish:** Stir in the fresh basil and balsamic vinegar. Taste and adjust with salt and pepper.
8.  **Serve:** Serve over [Fresh Egg Pasta](/recipes/fresh-egg-pasta) with plenty of Parmesan.
