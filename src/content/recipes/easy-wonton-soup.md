## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate 25-minute quick meal. The secret to making store-bought broth taste like a restaurant version is **The Aromatic Smasher Method**: instead of mincing ginger and garlic, we smash them with the side of a knife. This releases the essential oils into the broth during the simmer without adding gritty textures. We maintain **Textural Balance** by adding the wontons and bok choy together at the end; this ensures the greens stay vibrant and the wonton skins keep their "Snap."

## Directions

1.  **Infuse:** In a large pot, bring the chicken broth to a boil. Add the smashed ginger and garlic. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
2.  **Add Veg:** Add the halved bok choy and sliced mushrooms. Simmer for 3 minutes until the mushrooms begin to soften.
3.  **Wontons:** Add the frozen wontons. Simmer for 2-3 minutes until they float and are heated through.
4.  **Finish:** Stir in the soy sauce and toasted sesame oil. Add a pinch of white pepper for the mandatory **High Note**.
5.  **Serve:** Divide into bowls, ensuring everyone gets 5 wontons. Garnish with fresh scallions.
