## Chef's Note

Quick wonton soup using store-bought frozen wontons makes a comforting 25-minute meal. The trick to elevating store-bought broth: smash ginger and garlic with the side of a knife (instead of mincing) and simmer them in the broth. This releases their essential oils without adding gritty texture. Add the wontons and bok choy together at the end so the greens stay vibrant and the wonton skins don't get mushy.

## Directions

1.  **Infuse:** In a large pot, bring the chicken broth to a boil. Add the smashed ginger and garlic. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
2.  **Add Veg:** Add the halved bok choy and sliced mushrooms. Simmer for 3 minutes until the mushrooms begin to soften.
3.  **Wontons:** Add the frozen wontons. Simmer for 2-3 minutes until they float and are heated through.
4.  **Finish:** Stir in the soy sauce and toasted sesame oil. Add a pinch of white pepper for the mandatory **High Note**.
5.  **Serve:** Divide into bowls, ensuring everyone gets 5 wontons. Garnish with fresh scallions.
