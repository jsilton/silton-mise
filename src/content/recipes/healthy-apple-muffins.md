## Chef's Note

Combining applesauce and Greek yogurt creates incredibly moist muffins without excessive oil—a healthier approach that maintains dense, cake-like texture. Including both grated apple (for moisture) and cubed apple (for textural crunch) ensures every bite has distinct character. Turbinado sugar sprinkled on top creates a crystalline, crunchy crust.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** Preheat oven to 425°F. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
2.  **The Apples:** Add the grated and cubed apples to the dry mix. Toss to coat—this prevents the fruit from sinking to the bottom.
3.  **Wet Mix:** In a separate bowl, whisk oil, maple syrup, eggs, yogurt, applesauce, and vanilla until smooth and aerated.
4.  **Combine:** Pour the wet into the dry. Stir with a spatula until **just combined**. A few streaks of flour are the mandatory guard against a tough muffin.
5.  **Bake:** Divide into a lined 12-cup tin. Sprinkle the turbinado sugar over the tops. Bake at 425°F for 13-16 minutes until golden and a toothpick comes out clean.
6.  **Cool:** Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes before removing.
