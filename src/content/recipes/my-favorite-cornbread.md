## Chef's Note

This is our baseline **Modularity** component for all Silton chili nights. The secret to its Success is **Structural Science** through **The Skillet Sizzle Pattern**: for the most elite, "Snappy" crust, preheat a 9-inch cast-iron skillet _with_ the butter inside until it is foaming. We use a combination of **Honey and Brown Sugar** to ensure a moist, dense "Bounce" that never turns crumbly. The buttermilk provides the mandatory **Acid Finish** needed to activate the baking soda for a tall, airy rise.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** Preheat oven to 400°F. In a large bowl, whisk together cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and honey until a thick paste forms. Whisk in the egg and then the buttermilk until smooth.
3.  **Combine:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Stir with a spatula until **just combined**—do not over-mix, or the cornbread will be tough.
4.  **The Sizzle:** If using a skillet, pour the hot butter from the pan into the batter, stir once, and pour the batter back into the hot skillet. If using a pan, grease and flour it first.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 20 minutes until the top is deep golden brown and the edges are crispy.
6.  **Cool:** Let cool for 5 minutes before slicing into squares.
