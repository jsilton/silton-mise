## Chef's Note

This Southern-style cornbread pairs perfectly with chili. For the crispiest crust, preheat a 9-inch cast-iron skillet with butter inside until foaming. Combining honey and brown sugar ensures moist, dense texture that never turns crumbly. Buttermilk's acidity activates baking soda for tall, airy rise.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** Preheat oven to 400°F. In a large bowl, whisk together cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and honey until a thick paste forms. Whisk in the egg and then the buttermilk until smooth.
3.  **Combine:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Stir with a spatula until **just combined**—do not over-mix, or the cornbread will be tough.
4.  **The Sizzle:** If using a skillet, pour the hot butter from the pan into the batter, stir once, and pour the batter back into the hot skillet. If using a pan, grease and flour it first.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 20 minutes until the top is deep golden brown and the edges are crispy.
6.  **Cool:** Let cool for 5 minutes before slicing into squares.
