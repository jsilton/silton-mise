## Chef's Note

The secret to kale that isn't tough or bitter is the massage technique. You must drizzle the raw kale with olive oil and salt and massage the leaves vigorously with your hands for 2 minutes; this breaks down the fibrous cellulose, resulting in a tender texture similar to cooked greens. We add the avocado only at the very end to prevent it from smashing into a paste, ensuring every bite has distinct, creamy pieces.

## Directions

1.  **The Massage:** Place the chopped kale in a large wide bowl. Drizzle with 2 tbsp of the olive oil and a pinch of salt. **Massage the leaves** with your hands for 2 minutes until they turn dark green and feel soft.
2.  **The Dressing:** In a small jar, whisk together the orange juice, zest, remaining olive oil, garlic, mustard, and honey until emulsified.
3.  **Combine:** Add the mango, feta, red onion, and toasted pepitas to the kale.
4.  **Toss:** Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently to coat.
5.  **Finish:** Gently fold in the avocado pieces just before serving for the mandatory **High Note** of creaminess.
