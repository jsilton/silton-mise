## Chef's Note
The secret to kale that isn't tough or bitter is **Structural Science** through **The Massage Pattern**. You must drizzle the raw kale with olive oil and salt and massage the leaves vigorously with your hands for 2 minutes; this breaks down the fibrous cellulose, resulting in a tender "Bounce" similar to cooked greens. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The Avocado Set**: we add the avocado only at the very end to prevent it from smashing into a paste, ensuring every bite has a distinct, creamy "Snap."

## Directions

1.  **The Massage:** Place the chopped kale in a large wide bowl. Drizzle with 2 tbsp of the olive oil and a pinch of salt. **Massage the leaves** with your hands for 2 minutes until they turn dark green and feel soft.
2.  **The Dressing:** In a small jar, whisk together the orange juice, zest, remaining olive oil, garlic, mustard, and honey until emulsified.
3.  **Combine:** Add the mango, feta, red onion, and toasted pepitas to the kale. 
4.  **Toss:** Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently to coat.
5.  **Finish:** Gently fold in the avocado pieces just before serving for the mandatory **High Note** of creaminess.
