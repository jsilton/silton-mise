## Chef's Note

This is a **Updated Classic** update to the classic carrot cake, re-engineered as a high-fiber nutritious breakfast. By using **Whole Wheat Flour** and **Greek Yogurt**, we achieve a dense, moist crumb that provides sustained energy. The secret to the texture is finely grating the carrots—they should almost melt into the batter during baking, providing moisture without the "mushy veggie" feel. This is the "Keeper" version for busy mornings.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 375°F (185°C). Grease an 8-inch square pan or line with parchment paper.
2.  **The Grate:** Finely grate the carrots using the small holes of a grater. Set aside.
3.  **The Emulsion:** In a large bowl, whisk the egg, sugars, oil, yogurt, and vanilla for 3-5 minutes until the sugar is completely dissolved and the mixture is pale and frothy.
4.  **Dry Mix:** Sift in the whole wheat flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Fold gently with a spatula.
5.  **Fold:** Add the grated carrots and chopped nuts. Fold until just combined—do not overmix, or the whole wheat flour will become tough.
6.  **Bake:** Pour into the prepared pan and tap lightly to remove air bubbles. Bake for 25-30 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean.
7.  **Cool:** Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. This cake is even better the next day once the spices have "bloomed."
