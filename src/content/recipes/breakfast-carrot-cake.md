## Directions

1. Choose two large fresh carrots, wash them, and peel and discard the skin.
2. Grate them using a small-holed grater. Finely grated carrot is better suitable for our soft carrot cake.
3. Set the grated carrot aside.
4. Preheat the oven to 375F (185C).
5. Grease a cake pan with oil or use butter paper to avoid sticking. I used an 8″ square cake pan. This recipe also works for the same size round cake pan or a standard bread loaf pan.
6. In a large mixing bowl, take one whole egg. Add a 1/4 cup of white sugar (either powdered sugar or superfine granulated sugar) and a 1/4 cup of brown sugar.
7. Measure and add 1/2 cup of canola oil, 1/3 cup of yogurt. If you don’t have yogurt, replace it with 1/4 cup milk. Next, add a tsp of vanilla extract.
8. Whisk the sugar and wet ingredients well with an egg beater for five minutes. If you use an electric beater, mix for two minutes in a low setting. The sugar should dissolve completely in the egg mixture. You have to powder before adding if you use big granulated sugar.
9. Sift in the dry ingredients one by one. Start with 1.25 cups of whole wheat flour. (You can also use all-purpose flour. Or use half and half wheat flour and plain flour.) Add 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon for spice. Nutmeg powder also suits well. Next add 3/4 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp of baking soda and 1/4 tsp of salt. Sift the flour and salts so that they mix evenly.
10. Now add the finely shredded carrots. I add a 1/4 cup of mixed chopped nuts, which is optional. Combine everything together with a spatula gently.
11. Fill the cake batter into the pan, and tap lightly to remove extra air bubbles.
12. Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven until done. The baking time may vary depending upon the pan size, consistency of the batter and temperature of the oven. Always keep an eye on it towards the end (from 20 minutes onwards) and check by inserting a toothpick. If it comes out clean, the carrot cake is ready.
13. Take out the pan and let cool for a few minutes.
14. Invert the cake and cool down the cake on a rack prior to serving
15. Tips for this healthy carrot cake:
16. 1) This carrot cake recipe can be made without egg. For the eggless version use a little extra yogurt or applesauce (1/2 cup instead of 1/3 cup).
17. 2) If you wish to use only brown sugar you can skip white sugar. But make sure the sugar granules are fine enough to blend well. If bigger granules are left without proper mixing they may give an unpleasant experience while biting this super-soft carrot cake.
18. 3) Likewise, the use of nuts is completely optional. Nuts give crunchy delicious bites for this carrot cake. Chopped pecans or chopped walnuts are perfect for this cake. Raisins can also be added.
19. 4) Instead of grated carrot, you can use blended carrots. But this adjusts the consistency of the batter which may alter the texture of this delicious carrot cake.
20. Peel and wash two large fresh carrots, discarding the skin.
21. Grate the carrots using a small-holed grater. Set aside.
22. Grease a 8" cake pan or a loaf pan with oil or butter.
23. Recipe:
24. Preheat the oven to 375F (185C).
25. In a large mixing bowl, add one egg, 1/4 cup of white sugar (powdered or superfine granules), 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 cup of oil, 1/3 cup of yogurt, and vanilla extract.
26. Whisk the sugar and wet ingredients well with a hand or electric mixer for five minutes. If you use an electric beater, mix for two minutes in a low setting. The sugar should dissolve completely in the egg mixture.
27. Sift in the dry ingredients one by one. Start with 1.25 cups of whole wheat flour. Add 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon or nutmeg for spice. Next add 3/4 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp of baking soda, and 1/4 tsp of salt.
28. Now add the finely grated carrot and chopped pecans, chopped walnuts, or other nuts if desired. Combine everything together with a spatula gently.
29. Fill the cake batter into the pan, and tap lightly to remove extra air bubbles.
30. Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven until done. The baking time may vary depending upon the pan size, consistency of the batter and temperature of the oven. Always keep an eye towards the end (from 20 mins onwards) and check by inserting a toothpick. If it comes out clean carrot cake is ready.
31. Take out the pan and let cool for a few minutes. Invert the cake and let cool on a rack before serving.
