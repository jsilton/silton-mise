## Chef's Note

The French Dip is all about the **Jus** (the juice). Most home versions are watery; we fix this by using **Soy Sauce** instead of just salt to provide a deep, dark umami base that mimics a 24-hour restaurant stock. The roast should be "shreddably" tender but still hold enough structure to be piled high on a toasted roll.

## Directions

1.  **Sear (Optional but better):** Sear the beef roast in a hot skillet with a little oil until browned on all sides. Place in the slow cooker.
2.  **Combine:** Add the sliced onion, garlic, stock, soy sauce, Worcestershire, and rosemary to the slow cooker.
3.  **Slow Cook:** Cook on **LOW** for 8 hours (or high for 4-5 hours) until the beef pulls apart with a fork.
4.  **Shred:** Remove beef to a cutting board. Shred into large chunks or slice thin.
5.  **Strain:** Pour the liquid from the slow cooker through a sieve into small individual dipping bowls (ramekins).
6.  **Assemble:** Split the rolls. Pile the beef onto each roll and top with a slice of provolone.
7.  **Toast:** Place the sandwiches under the **BROILER** for 1-2 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and the bread is toasted.
8.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with the hot Jus on the side for dipping.
