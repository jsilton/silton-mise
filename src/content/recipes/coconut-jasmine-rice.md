## Chef's Note

Coconut rice is a staple throughout Southeast Asia, appearing in Thai, Indonesian, Malaysian, and Filipino cuisines. The rice absorbs the rich coconut milk while cooking, creating a creamy, subtly sweet base that pairs beautifully with spicy curries, grilled meats, and stir-fries. The key is using the right ratio: 1 part coconut milk to 1 part water prevents the rice from becoming too heavy while still delivering that signature coconut flavor. Always use full-fat coconut milk - the reduced-fat version doesn't have enough fat to coat the rice properly.

## Directions

1.  **Rinse the Rice:** Place jasmine rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold water, swishing with your hand, until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and prevents gummy rice.

2.  **Combine Liquids:** In a medium saucepan or rice cooker, shake the can of coconut milk well to combine the cream and liquid. Pour the coconut milk, water, salt, and sugar (if using) into the pot. Stir to dissolve the salt and sugar. If using pandan leaves, tie them in a knot and add to the pot.

3.  **Add Rice:** Add the rinsed rice to the coconut milk mixture and stir once to distribute evenly.

4.  **Cook (Stovetop Method):** Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, uncovered. Once boiling, reduce heat to the lowest setting, cover tightly with a lid, and simmer for 15 minutes without lifting the lid.

5.  **Cook (Rice Cooker Method):** Simply close the lid and cook on the white rice setting. The coconut milk won't affect the timing.

6.  **Rest:** After 15 minutes (stovetop) or when the rice cooker switches to warm, turn off the heat and let the rice rest, covered, for 5-10 minutes. This allows the rice to finish steaming and absorb any remaining liquid.

7.  **Fluff and Serve:** Remove pandan leaves if used. Fluff the rice gently with a fork or rice paddle. Serve warm as a base for curries, stir-fries, grilled proteins, or as part of a rice bowl.
