## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate "In the Park" cocktail—refreshing, low-sugar, and aromatic. We use **Hendricks** for its botanical cucumber notes, which pair perfectly with the real-fruit acidity of Spindrift. The secret is the **Grapefruit Bitters**: it provides the "High Note" that bridges the gin and the juice.

## Directions

1.  **Shake:** In a cocktail shaker filled with ice, combine the gin, lime juice, and agave. Shake vigorously for 15 seconds until ice-cold.
2.  **Strain:** Strain into three glasses filled with fresh ice.
3.  **Top:** Top each glass with the Spindrift Grapefruit.
4.  **Finish:** Add 2 dashes of bitters to each glass. Stir gently once to combine.
5.  **Garnish:** Top with a lime wheel.
