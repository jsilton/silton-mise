## Chef's Note

Great Souvlaki is about **Acid and Aroma**. We marinate the chicken in a heavy dose of dried oregano and lemon juice to tenderize the meat and provide that signature Mediterranean zing. To get the best result at home, use **Chicken Thighs** and sear them in a cast-iron skillet (or on a grill) until they have crispy, charred edges.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** Whisk the olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, garlic, salt, and pepper. Toss with the chicken cubes. Let marinate for at least 30 minutes (up to 4 hours).
2.  **Skewer:** Thread the chicken onto skewers. (If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 20 minutes first).
3.  **Sear:** Heat a grill or heavy skillet to medium-high. Lightly oil the grates.
4.  **Cook:** Grill for 3-4 minutes per side until charred and the internal temp is 160°F.
5.  **Rest:** Let rest for 5 minutes. The juices will redistribute and carryover heat will finish the cook.
6.  **Finish:** Squeeze a final hit of fresh lemon over the hot skewers.
