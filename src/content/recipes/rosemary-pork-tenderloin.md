## Chef's Note

Wrapping lean pork tenderloins in maple bacon prevents them from drying out—the bacon fat renders and bastes the meat as it roasts. Marinating in Dijon mustard, garlic, and rosemary for an hour before cooking tenderizes the meat while creating a flavorful crust. Pulling the pork at 145°F ensures a blush-pink center; the 10-minute rest allows juices to redistribute without overcooking.

## Directions

1.  **Glue:** Whisk Dijon, minced garlic, pepper, and minced rosemary. Rub heavily over the pork. Wrap in plastic and **refrigerate for 1 hour**.
2.  **Wrap:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Remove pork from plastic. Lay 2 bacon slices over each tenderloin. Secure with kitchen twine.
3.  **Thermal Prep:** Place whole rosemary sprigs and smashed garlic in a roasting pan. Lay the pork directly on top of the herbs.
4.  **Roast:** Bake for 25-30 minutes until an instant-read thermometer hits **145°F**.
5.  **Rest:** Transfer to a board and **let rest for 10 minutes** (mandatory).
6.  **Serve:** Remove twine, slice into 1-inch rounds, and garnish with the roasted rosemary.
