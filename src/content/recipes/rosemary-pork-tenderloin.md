## Chef's Note
This is the "Gold Standard" for technical pork roasting. The secret to Success is **Structural Science** through **The Bacon Anchor Pattern**: we wrap the tenderloins in maple bacon and secure them with twine. The bacon fat renders into the lean pork, providing a self-basting "Bounce." We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The 1-Hour Marinate**: the mustard acts as an enzyme tenderizer while the rosemary-garlic glue provides a savory "Snap" to the crust. Always pull at 145°F for a perfect blush-pink center.

## Directions

1.  **Glue:** Whisk Dijon, minced garlic, pepper, and minced rosemary. Rub heavily over the pork. Wrap in plastic and **refrigerate for 1 hour**.
2.  **Wrap:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Remove pork from plastic. Lay 2 bacon slices over each tenderloin. Secure with kitchen twine.
3.  **Thermal Prep:** Place whole rosemary sprigs and smashed garlic in a roasting pan. Lay the pork directly on top of the herbs.
4.  **Roast:** Bake for 25-30 minutes until an instant-read thermometer hits **145°F** (The Carry-Over Standard).
5.  **Rest:** Transfer to a board and **let rest for 10 minutes** (mandatory).
6.  **Serve:** Remove twine, slice into 1-inch rounds, and garnish with the roasted rosemary.
