## Chef's Note

This is the **Kitchen Standard** for rustic mashed potatoes. To ensure **Textural Balance**, we use the **Skin-on Standard**: leaving the red skins provides a textural Crunch and earthy nutritious that peeled potatoes lack. The secret to the Kitchen Standard is **The Infused Boil**: we boil the whole garlic cloves directly with the potatoes. This mellows the garlic's bite and allows its oils to penetrate the starch as it cooks, resulting in a deeper, more integrated flavor than adding raw garlic at the end.

## Directions

1.  **The Infuse:** Place the potatoes and the garlic cloves in a large pot. Cover with cold salted water.
2.  **Boil:** Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes until the potatoes are fork-tender.
3.  **Drain:** Drain the potatoes and garlic thoroughly. Return to the hot pot for 1 minute to "steam off" any residual surface moisture (mandatory for texture).
4.  **Mash:** Add the butter, salt, and pepper. Start mashing by hand (for a rustic texture).
5.  **The Emulsion:** Gradually add the warmed milk and Parmesan. Continue mashing until the mixture is creamy but still has distinct "pops" of red skin.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with a crack of black pepper.
