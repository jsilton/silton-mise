## Chef's Note

Leaving red skins on provides texture and earthy flavor that peeled potatoes lack. Boiling whole garlic cloves with the potatoes mellows garlic's bite and infuses its oils into the starch as it cooks - more integrated flavor than adding raw garlic at the end. Return drained potatoes to hot pot for 1 minute to steam off surface moisture.

## Directions

1.  **The Infuse:** Place the potatoes and the garlic cloves in a large pot. Cover with cold salted water.
2.  **Boil:** Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes until the potatoes are fork-tender.
3.  **Drain:** Drain the potatoes and garlic thoroughly. Return to the hot pot for 1 minute to "steam off" any residual surface moisture (mandatory for texture).
4.  **Mash:** Add the butter, salt, and pepper. Start mashing by hand (for a rustic texture).
5.  **The Emulsion:** Gradually add the warmed milk and Parmesan. Continue mashing until the mixture is creamy but still has distinct "pops" of red skin.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with a crack of black pepper.
