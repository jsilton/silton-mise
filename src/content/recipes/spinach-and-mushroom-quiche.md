## Chef's Note

The secret to a "Gold Standard" quiche is **Texture Integrity** through **The Triple-Sauté Pattern**. You must sear the mushrooms until they are browned and dry, then sauté the onions until tender, and finally wilt the spinach _separately_ from the eggs. This ensures the custard remains creamy and "Bouncy" rather than watery. We use **Dijon Mustard** as a structural binder: whisking it into the eggs provides a subtle **Acid Finish** that bridges the gap between the earthy mushrooms and rich Gruyère.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a 9-inch pie pan with the crust and prick with a fork.
2.  **The Snap:** In a large skillet, sauté mushrooms in oil until deep golden and all moisture has evaporated (8 mins). Add onion and garlic; cook for 5 minutes until soft.
3.  **The Wilt:** Add the spinach. Toss for 1 minute until just collapsed. Remove from heat and let cool.
4.  **The Emulsion:** In a large bowl, whisk eggs, milk, half-and-half, mustard, thyme, salt, and pepper until very frothy.
5.  **Assemble:** Fold the mushroom-spinach mixture and the cheese into the egg base. Pour into the prepared crust.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 30-35 minutes until the center is set and the top is deep golden brown.
7.  **Set:** Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing—this is mandatory for the structural integrity of the "Bounce."
