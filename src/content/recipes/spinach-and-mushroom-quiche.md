## Chef's Note

Quiche is a savory French tart from the Lorraine region, traditionally made with eggs, cream, and bacon. Searing mushrooms until browned and dry, sautéing onions until tender, and wilting spinach separately before mixing into the custard prevents excess moisture that would make the quiche watery. Whisking Dijon mustard into the eggs adds subtle tang that bridges earthy mushrooms and rich Gruyère cheese.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a 9-inch pie pan with the crust and prick with a fork.
2.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet, sauté mushrooms in oil until deep golden and all moisture has evaporated (8 mins). Add onion and garlic; cook for 5 minutes until soft.
3.  **The Wilt:** Add the spinach. Toss for 1 minute until just collapsed. Remove from heat and let cool.
4.  **The Emulsion:** In a large bowl, whisk eggs, milk, half-and-half, mustard, thyme, salt, and pepper until very frothy.
5.  **Assemble:** Fold the mushroom-spinach mixture and the cheese into the egg base. Pour into the prepared crust.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 30-35 minutes until the center is set and the top is deep golden brown.
7.  **Set:** Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing—this is mandatory for the structural integrity of the "Bounce."
