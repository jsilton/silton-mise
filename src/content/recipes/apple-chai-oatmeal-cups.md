## Chef's Note

This is a "Grab-and-Go" fuel staple. To elevate the flavor, we use the **Blooming Pattern**: stir the chai spices into the **melted coconut oil** before adding to the wet mix. This releases the fat-soluble aromas of the cardamom and cinnamon, ensuring the spice flavor is baked into every oat rather than just sitting on the surface.

## Directions

1.  **Bloom:** In a small bowl, whisk the melted coconut oil with all the chai spices. Let sit for 2 minutes.
2.  **Dry:** In a large bowl, combine the oats and baking powder.
3.  **Wet:** In another bowl, whisk the mashed banana, eggs, milk, and maple syrup. Stir in the spiced coconut oil.
4.  **Combine:** Pour the wet mixture over the oats. Fold in the minced apples.
5.  **Bake:** Scoop into a lined 12-count muffin tin. Bake at 350°F for 20 minutes until the tops are firm and golden.
6.  **Cool:** Let cool for 10 minutes in the tin to allow the oats to set.
