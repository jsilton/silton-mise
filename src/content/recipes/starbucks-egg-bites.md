## Chef's Note

Starbucks popularized sous-vide egg bites with their distinctive velvety texture. Blending eggs with full-fat cottage cheese introduces protein-rich moisture that creates custardy texture standard egg muffins lack. Topping each bite with crispy bacon before baking ensures savory crunch on the surface. Placing a tray of water on the bottom oven rack creates a steam bath that keeps the egg bites moist during baking.

## Directions

1.  **Emulsify:** Preheat oven to 350°F. In a high-speed blender, combine eggs, cottage cheese, salt, and pepper. Blend on high for 30 seconds until completely smooth and frothy.
2.  **Bind:** Pour the mixture into a bowl. Gently fold in the shredded Gruyère cheese.
3.  **Assemble:** Generously grease a 12-cup silicone muffin tin. Fill each cup 2/3 full with the egg mixture.
4.  **The Crunch:** Top each cup with a sprinkle of the chopped bacon. Press down slightly with a spoon to anchor it.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 20-25 minutes until the centers are set but not brown.
6.  **The Finish:** Let rest in the pan for 10 minutes (mandatory). Gently pop them out with a knife.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 5 days.
