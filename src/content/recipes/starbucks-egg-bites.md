## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 12 cup muffin tin generously with a non-stick cooking spray.
2. Combine the eggs, cottage cheese, salt and pepper together in a blender. Blend until smooth.
3. Then pour into a bowl and stir in the shredded gruyere cheese.
4. Pour this mixture evenly into the muffin tins. Fill each tin approximately 2/3 of the way full as the eggs will rise as they cook.
5. Top each egg bite with the chopped bacon and gently press them down with a spoon so they are in the egg mixture and not just on top.
6. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the eggs are set.
7. Remove the pan from the oven and let the egg bites rest for 5-10 minutes. Gently remove the egg bites from the pan with a spoon and then they are ready to serve and enjoy!
