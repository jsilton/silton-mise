## Chef's Note

The secret to the iconic "Velvet" texture of professional egg bites is **Culinary Technique** through **The Blender Emulsion**. By blending the eggs with full-fat cottage cheese, we introduce a massive amount of protein-rich moisture that creates a custardy Texture standard egg muffins lack. We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Bacon Press**: we top each bite with crispy bacon _before_ baking, ensuring a savory Crunch on the surface. For the ultimate Kitchen Standard result, place a tray of water on the bottom rack of the oven to create a "Steam Bath" during baking.

## Directions

1.  **Emulsify:** Preheat oven to 350°F. In a high-speed blender, combine eggs, cottage cheese, salt, and pepper. Blend on high for 30 seconds until completely smooth and frothy.
2.  **Bind:** Pour the mixture into a bowl. Gently fold in the shredded Gruyère cheese.
3.  **Assemble:** Generously grease a 12-cup silicone muffin tin. Fill each cup 2/3 full with the egg mixture.
4.  **The Crunch:** Top each cup with a sprinkle of the chopped bacon. Press down slightly with a spoon to anchor it.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 20-25 minutes until the centers are set but not brown.
6.  **The Finish:** Let rest in the pan for 10 minutes (mandatory). Gently pop them out with a knife.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 5 days.
