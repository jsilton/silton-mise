## Chef's Note

This is the baseline for all elite Italian dishes in our kitchen. We use **Culinary Technique** through **The Food Processor Emulsion Method**: instead of the messy "well" method, we use the high-speed blade to instantly emulsify the eggs and flour, ensuring a perfectly uniform protein structure. The most critical step is **The Hydration Rest**: you must let the dough sit for at least 1 hour. This allows the flour's starches to fully hydrate, resulting in a Texture that is tender yet snappy (al dente) rather than gummy.

## Directions

1.  **The Emulsion:** Place flour and salt in a food processor. Pulse twice. Add eggs, yolks, and oil. Run the processor until the dough forms a shaggy ball (about 30 seconds). If too dry, add 1 tsp oil; if too wet, add 1 tbsp flour.
2.  **Knead:** Transfer to a work surface. Knead by hand for 2-3 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
3.  **The Rest:** Wrap tightly in plastic wrap. **Rest for at least 1 hour** at room temperature (or overnight in the fridge).
4.  **Roll:** Divide dough into 4 pieces. Use a pasta machine on the widest setting. Fold the sheet in thirds like a letter and pass through again. Repeat on each setting until you reach the desired thickness (Setting 6 or 7 for fettuccine).
5.  **Shape:** Cut into ribbons or shapes. Dust with flour and arrange in "nests" on a parchment-lined sheet.
6.  **Boil:** Cook in a massive pot of heavily salted water for 1-3 minutes until they float and the center is cooked through.
