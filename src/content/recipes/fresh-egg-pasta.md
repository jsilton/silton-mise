## Chef's Note

Fresh egg pasta (pasta all'uovo) is traditional in Northern Italy, particularly Emilia-Romagna (Bologna, Modena, Parma), where it's made with soft wheat flour and eggs. The classic method is making a "well" of flour and cracking eggs into the center, but a food processor is much faster and creates a perfectly uniform dough. The critical step is resting the dough for at least 1 hour after kneading - this allows the flour's gluten to relax and the starches to fully hydrate, resulting in pasta that's tender yet has a pleasant bite (al dente) when cooked. Use Italian "00" flour if you can find it - it's finely milled and makes silkier pasta.

## Directions

1.  **The Emulsion:** Place flour and salt in a food processor. Pulse twice. Add eggs, yolks, and oil. Run the processor until the dough forms a shaggy ball (about 30 seconds). If too dry, add 1 tsp oil; if too wet, add 1 tbsp flour.
2.  **Knead:** Transfer to a work surface. Knead by hand for 2-3 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
3.  **The Rest:** Wrap tightly in plastic wrap. **Rest for at least 1 hour** at room temperature (or overnight in the fridge).
4.  **Roll:** Divide dough into 4 pieces. Use a pasta machine on the widest setting. Fold the sheet in thirds like a letter and pass through again. Repeat on each setting until you reach the desired thickness (Setting 6 or 7 for fettuccine).
5.  **Shape:** Cut into ribbons or shapes. Dust with flour and arrange in "nests" on a parchment-lined sheet.
6.  **Boil:** Cook in a massive pot of heavily salted water for 1-3 minutes until they float and the center is cooked through.
