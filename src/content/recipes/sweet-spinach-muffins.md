## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 F, and line a muffin pan with paper liners (or use silicone muffin cups sprayed with cooking spray).
2. Combine all dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl.
3. Melt butter. Blend the wet ingredients in a blender or food processor until completely pureed.
4. Pour the puree into the dry ingredient bowl, and fold together gently until just combined. (Do not over-mix.)
5. Spoon the batter into the muffin pan, and bake for 18-22 minutes, or until the muffins are firm to the touch on top, but not quite browning.
6. Cool most or all of the way before serving.
