## Chef's Note

These are quick fuel for children and busy adults. The key is blending the raw spinach, banana, and wet ingredients in a high-speed blender until it becomes a vibrant, neon-green liquid. This ensures the spinach is completely pulverized, resulting in a tender, cake-like texture where the vegetable acts as a moisture guard rather than a chunky intrusion. The cinnamon provides aromatic warmth.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a blender, combine the spinach, banana, melted butter, honey, milk, egg, and vanilla. Blend on high for 60 seconds until perfectly smooth and vibrant green.
3.  **Combine:** Pour the green emulsion into the dry ingredients. Stir with a spatula until **just combined**. Do not over-mix, or the muffins will be tough.
4.  **Bake:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Line two muffin tins (18 cups). Fill each 3/4 full. Bake for 18-22 minutes until the tops spring back when touched.
5.  **Cool:** Let cool completely in the pan to allow the moisture to set into a "Bounce."
