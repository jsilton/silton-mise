## Chef's Note

Tahini is an oil-rich paste that can behave unexpectedly. When you add lemon juice, it will often "seize" and turn thick and grainy. The secret to a silky, pourable sauce is **Emulsifying with Ice Water**. By whisking in cold water a tablespoon at a time, you force the fat and liquid to bind into a pale, creamy emulsion that is perfect for drizzling over shawarma or roasted veg.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the tahini, lemon juice, grated garlic, and salt. The mixture will likely thicken and look "broken"—this is normal.
2.  **The Emulsion:** Whisk in the ice-cold water, one tablespoon at a time. Continue whisking until the sauce turns pale and reaches the consistency of heavy cream.
3.  **Balance:** Taste and adjust for salt or acid. If it's too thick, add another splash of water.
4.  **Serve:** Serve as a dip or a drizzle.
