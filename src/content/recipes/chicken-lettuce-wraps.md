## Chef's Note

Chicken lettuce wraps became popular through restaurants like P.F. Chang's in the 1990s. This version replaces water chestnuts with finely diced celery for a fresher, crisper texture without the chalky mouthfeel. The key is browning the ground chicken over high heat until it has crispy edges before adding the hoisin glaze—this prevents soggy lettuce cups. Serve in cold butter lettuce leaves for the best presentation.

## Directions

1.  **Protein:** Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat with 1 tbsp oil. Add the ground chicken. Cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until it is no longer pink and has some golden brown edges.
2.  **Aromatics:** Add the celery, ginger, and garlic. Stir-fry for 2 minutes until the celery is slightly softened but still has a firm "pop."
3.  **Glaze:** Stir in the hoisin, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. Toss vigorously for 1 minute until the chicken is evenly coated and the sauce is bubbling.
4.  **Finish:** Stir in the green onions. Remove from heat.
5.  **Serve:** Spoon the mixture into cold lettuce cups. Top with chili crisp or crispy noodles if using.
