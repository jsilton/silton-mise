## Chef's Note

The tragedy of the standard "Chicken and Broccoli Bake" is the mushy, gray broccoli and the canned soup base. We apply the **Executive Texture Method**: we **Sear** the chicken and **Roast** the broccoli at high heat to get charred edges _before_ adding our scratch-made cheese sauce. This ensures every component maintains its integrity rather than turning into a uniform paste.

## Directions

1.  **The Roast:** Preheat oven to 425°F. On a large sheet pan, toss the broccoli florets and chicken chunks with oil, salt, and pepper. Roast for 15 minutes until chicken is golden and broccoli is charred at the tips.
2.  **The Sauce (The Roux):** While roasting, melt butter in a small pot. Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute (The Roux). Gradually whisk in broth until a thick gravy forms. Remove from heat and stir in the cheese and garlic powder.
3.  **Combine:** Transfer the roasted chicken and broccoli to a small baking dish. Pour the cheese sauce over the top.
4.  **the crunch:** Toss panko with a little oil and sprinkle over the sauce.
5.  **Finish:** Bake for 10 minutes (or broil for 2 mins) until the top is bubbling and brown.
