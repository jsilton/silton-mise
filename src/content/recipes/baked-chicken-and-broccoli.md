## Chef's Note

Roasting the chicken and broccoli at 425°F before adding the cheese sauce prevents mushiness - the high heat caramelizes the broccoli edges and browns the chicken while each component stays distinct. The from-scratch roux-based cheddar sauce is lighter than canned soup but just as comforting.

## Directions

1.  **The Roast:** Preheat oven to 425°F. On a large sheet pan, toss the broccoli florets and chicken chunks with oil, salt, and pepper. Roast for 15 minutes until chicken is golden and broccoli is charred at the tips.
2.  **The Sauce (The Roux):** While roasting, melt butter in a small pot. Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute (The Roux). Gradually whisk in broth until a thick gravy forms. Remove from heat and stir in the cheese and garlic powder.
3.  **Combine:** Transfer the roasted chicken and broccoli to a small baking dish. Pour the cheese sauce over the top.
4.  **the crunch:** Toss panko with a little oil and sprinkle over the sauce.
5.  **Finish:** Bake for 10 minutes (or broil for 2 mins) until the top is bubbling and brown.
