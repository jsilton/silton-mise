## Chef's Note

Sliced strawberries macerated in lemon juice and sugar for several hours draw out natural syrup and soften the fruit, preventing them from freezing into icy chunks. Tempering yolks with hot milk and vanilla bean ensures dense, custardy texture that showcases bright strawberries perfectly.

## Directions

1.  **Macerate:** Toss strawberries with lemon juice and 1/4 cup sugar. **Refrigerate for at least 3 hours** until syrupy.
2.  **Custard Base:** In a saucepan, heat milk, cream, and vanilla bean seeds until simmering.
3.  **Emulsify:** In a large bowl, whisk yolks, salt, and remaining sugars until pale. Slowly whisk in the hot cream to temper.
4.  **Thicken:** Return mixture to the pan. Cook over medium-low, stirring constantly, until the custard coats a spoon. **Do not boil.**
5.  **Chill:** Remove vanilla pod. Let cool for 30 minutes, then refrigerate for **at least 4 hours** until ice-cold.
6.  **Churn:** Stir the macerated strawberries (including all juice) into the custard. Pour into ice cream maker and process for 25-35 minutes.
7.  **Set:** Freeze for 2 hours to harden into the Kitchen Standard texture.
