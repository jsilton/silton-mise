## Chef's Note
The secret to "Restaurant Quality" strawberry ice cream is **The Maceration Pattern**. You must let the sliced strawberries sit in lemon juice and sugar for several hours before churning; this draws out the natural syrup and softens the fruit, preventing them from freezing into "icy bullets." We use **The Yolk Emulsion Pattern**: tempering the yolks with hot milk and vanilla bean ensures a dense, custardy "Bounce" that provides a perfect stage for the bright strawberry **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **Macerate:** Toss strawberries with lemon juice and 1/4 cup sugar. **Refrigerate for at least 3 hours** until syrupy.
2.  **Custard Base:** In a saucepan, heat milk, cream, and vanilla bean seeds until simmering. 
3.  **Emulsify:** In a large bowl, whisk yolks, salt, and remaining sugars until pale. Slowly whisk in the hot cream to temper.
4.  **Thicken:** Return mixture to the pan. Cook over medium-low, stirring constantly, until the custard coats a spoon. **Do not boil.**
5.  **Chill:** Remove vanilla pod. Let cool for 30 minutes, then refrigerate for **at least 4 hours** until ice-cold.
6.  **Churn:** Stir the macerated strawberries (including all juice) into the custard. Pour into ice cream maker and process for 25-35 minutes.
7.  **Set:** Freeze for 2 hours to harden into the Gold Standard texture.
