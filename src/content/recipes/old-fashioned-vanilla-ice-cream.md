## Chef's Note

This classic custard-based vanilla ice cream forms the foundation for countless desserts. Slowly whisking hot milk into egg yolks prevents scrambling while creating stable emulsion. Vanilla bean paste provides deeper, more resinous aroma than extract, plus visual flecks of black seeds. Chilling the base up to 24 hours produces creamier final texture.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a small saucepan, heat milk over medium-low until just simmering.
2.  **Emulsify:** In a medium bowl, whisk egg yolks and sugar until pale yellow. Slowly stream in the hot milk while whisking constantly.
3.  **Thicken:** Return the mixture to the pan. Heat until it reaches 165°F and coats the back of a spoon. **Do not boil.**
4.  **The Chill:** Transfer to a container and refrigerate for **at least 4 hours** (overnight is best) until cold.
5.  **Churn:** Stir in the heavy cream and vanilla bean paste. Pour into your ice cream maker.
6.  **Set:** Churn according to instructions (usually 20 mins). Transfer to a freezer-safe container and freeze for 2 hours before serving.
