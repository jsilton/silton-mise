## Chef's Note

This is the baseline **Modularity** component for all Executive desserts. The secret to its incredible Texture is **Culinary Technique** through **The Tempering Method**: you must slowly whisk the hot milk into the egg yolks to ensure a stable emulsion without scrambling the proteins. We use **Vanilla Bean Paste** instead of extract to provide the mandatory visual "High Note" of black seeds and a deeper, more resinous aroma. The longer you chill the base (up to 24 hours), the creamier the final snap will be.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a small saucepan, heat milk over medium-low until just simmering.
2.  **Emulsify:** In a medium bowl, whisk egg yolks and sugar until pale yellow. Slowly stream in the hot milk while whisking constantly.
3.  **Thicken:** Return the mixture to the pan. Heat until it reaches 165°F and coats the back of a spoon. **Do not boil.**
4.  **The Chill:** Transfer to a container and refrigerate for **at least 4 hours** (overnight is best) until cold.
5.  **Churn:** Stir in the heavy cream and vanilla bean paste. Pour into your ice cream maker.
6.  **Set:** Churn according to instructions (usually 20 mins). Transfer to a freezer-safe container and freeze for 2 hours before serving.
