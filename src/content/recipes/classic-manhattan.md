The Manhattan, created in the 1870s, is one of the most iconic American cocktails. This spirit-forward classic combines whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters for a perfectly balanced, sophisticated drink.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz rye whiskey (or bourbon for a sweeter Manhattan)
- 1 oz sweet vermouth
- 2 dashes Angostura bitters
- Ice for stirring
- Maraschino cherry for garnish
- Orange peel (optional)

## Directions

1. Add the whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters to a mixing glass filled with ice.

2. Stir well for 20-30 seconds until properly chilled and diluted.

3. Strain into a chilled coupe or cocktail glass.

4. Garnish with a maraschino cherry and optionally express an orange peel over the drink.

5. Serve immediately.

## Chef's Note

For the best Manhattan, use quality ingredients - a good rye whiskey (like Rittenhouse or Sazerac Rye) and fresh sweet vermouth (Carpano Antica Formula is excellent). The key is proper stirring: enough to chill and dilute, but not so much that it becomes watery. A 2:1 ratio is classic, but adjust to taste. For a Perfect Manhattan, use equal parts sweet and dry vermouth.
