The Manhattan, created in the 1870s, is one of the most iconic American cocktails. This spirit-forward classic combines whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters for a perfectly balanced, sophisticated drink.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz rye whiskey (or bourbon for a sweeter Manhattan)
- 1 oz sweet vermouth
- 2 dashes Angostura bitters
- Ice for stirring
- Maraschino cherry for garnish
- Orange peel (optional)

## Directions

1. Add the whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters to a mixing glass filled with ice.

2. Stir well for 20-30 seconds until properly chilled and diluted.

3. Strain into a chilled coupe or cocktail glass.

4. Garnish with a maraschino cherry and optionally express an orange peel over the drink.

5. Serve immediately.

## Chef's Note

The Manhattan was created in the 1870s and is one of the oldest American cocktails, born during the golden age of pre-Prohibition bartending. Legend claims it was invented at the Manhattan Club in New York for a party hosted by Winston Churchill's mother, though this story is likely apocryphal. What's certain is that it became the template for countless whiskey cocktails. The 2:1 ratio of whiskey to vermouth is classic, but you can adjust to taste - some prefer a drier 3:1 Manhattan.
