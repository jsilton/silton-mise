## Chef's Note

The key to restaurant-quality spareribs is baking the ribs tightly sealed in heavy-duty foil. This allows the meat to steam in the gochujang marinade, breaking down the tough connective tissue into succulent meat without losing any flavor to a pot of water. We finish by grilling the sections at high heat for the final 4 minutes to ensure the sugar-rich sauce sets into a sticky, mahogany glaze.

## Directions

1.  **The Sauce:** In a large bowl, whisk together gochujang, hoisin, honey, soy sauce, sake, vinegar, and all aromatics until smooth.
2.  **Braise:** Preheat oven to 325°F. Layout three double-layers of heavy-duty foil. Place 1 rack of ribs in the center of each.
3.  **Seal:** Brush each rack with 3/4 cup of the sauce. Wrap tightly to ensure no steam escapes. Place on rimmed baking sheets.
4.  **Bake:** Bake for 2 hours until the meat is tender but not quite falling off the bone.
5.  **The Crunch:** Preheat a grill to high. Remove ribs from foil and cut into 4-rib sections.
6.  **Glaze:** Brush with remaining sauce. Grill for 2-3 minutes per side until charred and the lacquer is bubbling.
7.  **Serve:** Transfer to a platter. Serve with extra lime wedges for the mandatory **Acid Balance**.
