## Chef's Note

Patate al forno are classic Italian oven-roasted potatoes—a Sunday staple in Roman homes. The secret to crispy edges is drying the potatoes thoroughly after cutting; any moisture will cause them to steam instead of crisp. Roasting at 450°F gets you golden, crunchy exteriors while keeping the insides creamy. Fresh rosemary is traditional and adds a wonderful aromatic note.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 450°F (mandatory for snap). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2.  **Dry:** Cube the potatoes. Place them in a bowl and pat **bone-dry** with multiple paper towels.
3.  **Toss:** Add the olive oil, salt, garlic powder, and rosemary. Toss vigorously until every chunk is heavily coated.
4.  **Spread:** Spread the potatoes in a **single layer** on the pan. If they are crowded, they will steam instead of crisp.
5.  **Roast:** Bake for 35-40 minutes. Flip with a metal spatula halfway through. They are done when they are deep mahogany gold and "pop" when bitten.
6.  **Serve:** Sprinkle with a final pinch of sea salt and serve immediately.
