A simpler, crispier version of roasted potatoes. By skipping the par-boil and using high heat, the potatoes develop a deep golden crust while remaining creamy inside. Yukon Golds are ideal for their natural buttery texture.

## Directions

1.  **Preheat:** Preheat oven to 450°F.
2.  **Prep:** Wash and dry potatoes thoroughly (moisture is the enemy of crispiness). Cut into 1-inch chunks.
3.  **Season:** In a large bowl, toss the potato chunks with olive oil, salt, garlic powder, and rosemary until well coated.
4.  **Roast:** Spread the potatoes in a single layer on a large rimmed baking sheet. Ensure they have space between them; if they are crowded, they will steam instead of crisp.
5.  **Crisp:** Roast for 35-40 minutes, flipping with a spatula halfway through, until the edges are deep brown and crispy.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately while hot.
