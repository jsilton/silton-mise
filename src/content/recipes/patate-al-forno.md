The definitive Roman-style roasted potato. The extra step of par-boiling creates a rough, starchy exterior that shatters into a glass-like crunch when roasted, while the inside stays creamy.

## Directions

1. Par-Boil: Preheat oven to 425°F. Place potato chunks in a pot of cold salted water. Boil for 7 minutes. (Outside should be soft, inside raw).Rough Up: Drain water. Shake the potatoes vigorously in the colander to "bruise" the edges. (This fuzz becomes the crunch).Season: Toss the hot potatoes in a bowl with olive oil, salt, garlic powder, and rosemary.Roast: Spread on a baking sheet (ensure they don't touch). Roast for 35 minutes, flipping once halfway through.Serve: Serve immediately while hot and crispy.
