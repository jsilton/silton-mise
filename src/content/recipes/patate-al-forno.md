## Chef's Note

This is the definitive Silton side dish. The secret to its Success is **Texture Integrity** through **The Bone-Dry Standard**. You must wash the cubed potatoes and then pat them with paper towels until they are perfectly dry; moisture is the enemy of the Maillard reaction. We use **The High-Heat Roast Pattern**: roasting at 450°F ensures a shatteringly crisp "Snap" on the skin while the internal starch of the Yukon Gold remains buttery and soft. The rosemary provides the mandatory aromatic **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 450°F (mandatory for snap). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2.  **Dry:** Cube the potatoes. Place them in a bowl and pat **bone-dry** with multiple paper towels.
3.  **Toss:** Add the olive oil, salt, garlic powder, and rosemary. Toss vigorously until every chunk is heavily coated.
4.  **Spread:** Spread the potatoes in a **single layer** on the pan. If they are crowded, they will steam instead of crisp.
5.  **Roast:** Bake for 35-40 minutes. Flip with a metal spatula halfway through. They are done when they are deep mahogany gold and "pop" when bitten.
6.  **Serve:** Sprinkle with a final pinch of sea salt and serve immediately.
