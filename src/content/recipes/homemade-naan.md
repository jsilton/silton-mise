## Chef's Note

Great Naan requires **Yogurt and High Heat**. The yogurt provides the fermentation tang and the tender, "bubbly" crumb. To achieve the restaurant-style char without a tandoor oven, we use a **Cast Iron Skillet** screaming hot. The steam trapped inside the dough creates the air pockets, while the direct contact with the iron creates the blackened "leopard spots."

## Directions

1.  **Dough:** In a large bowl, whisk flour, yeast, sugar, and salt. Add yogurt, oil, and warm water. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.
2.  **Knead:** Knead for 5-8 minutes until smooth. It should be soft and slightly tacky.
3.  **Rise:** Place in an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm spot for 60-90 minutes until doubled.
4.  **Shape:** Divide dough into 8 balls. Roll each into an oval about 1/4-inch thick.
5.  **Sear:** Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat. Do not add oil. Place one dough oval in the dry pan.
6.  **Bubble:** Cook for 1-2 minutes until large bubbles form on the top. Flip and cook for 1 minute until charred on the other side.
7.  **Finish:** Brush immediately with garlic-butter and sprinkle with cilantro. Keep warm in a clean kitchen towel.
