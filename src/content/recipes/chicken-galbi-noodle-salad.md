## Chef's Note

This dish is a play on Korean Japchae but served as a bright, protein-heavy salad. To elevate the texture, we add **Toasted Seeds** and ensure the bell peppers remain raw and crunchy to contrast with the "bouncy" chew of the glass noodles.

## Directions

1.  **Noodles:** Boil glass noodles for 7-8 minutes until translucent and chewy. Drain and rinse with cold water. **Tip:** Use kitchen shears to cut the noodles into manageable 6-inch lengths.
2.  **Protein:** In a skillet over medium-high heat, sauté the chicken with half of the galbi marinade. Cook until the liquid evaporates and the chicken is caramelized and slightly crispy.
3.  **Toss:** In a large bowl, combine the cold noodles, the hot chicken, the remaining marinade, and the sesame oil.
4.  **Crunch:** Fold in the raw bell peppers, fresh herbs, and toasted sesame seeds.
5.  **Serve:** Serve warm or at room temperature. The noodles will absorb the flavors as they sit.
