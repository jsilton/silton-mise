## Directions

1. In a large pot of boiling water, cook noodles until tender and translucent, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a colander to drain, then run under cold water to stop the cooking. Drain well then transfer to a large bowl.
2. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
3. In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, combine 2 tablespoons of the oil with the garlic and ginger over medium. When it starts sizzling, stir for 30 seconds, then add chicken and scallions. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up the meat until it’s no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
4. Increase heat to medium-high and add 1/4 cup of the sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, until all of the liquid is absorbed and chicken is lightly caramelized, 5 minutes.
5. Transfer chicken mixture to the bowl with the noodles. Add bell pepper, basil, remaining sauce and 1 tablespoon oil. Toss with your hands until well incorporated; season with salt and pepper.
6. Divide among bowls and serve warm or at room temperature.
