## Directions

1. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, stir together the butter and vanilla. Mix in the Greek yogurt, stirring until no large lumps remain. (If the butter or coconut oil re-solidifies, briefly microwave the mixture for 10-15 seconds.) Alternate between adding the flour mixture and the milk, beginning and ending with the flour, stirring just until incorporated. (For best results, add the flour mixture in 4 equal parts.) Gently fold in the peaches.
2. Lightly coat a large nonstick pan or griddle with nonstick cooking spray, and preheat over low heat.
3. Using 2 tablespoons of batter for each pancake, dollop the batter onto the hot pan, and spread into a circular shape if desired. Let the pancakes cook for 2-3 minutes, or until a slight skin starts to form around the edges and the bottom is light golden brown. Slide a spatula underneath, and flip. Continue to cook for another 1-2 minutes or until light golden brown on both sides. (Remember to re-coat the pan with nonstick cooking spray before cooking the next round of pancake batter!) Top the pancakes with pure maple syrup, if desired.
