## Chef's Note
The secret to "Peach Pie" pancakes that aren't heavy is **Structural Science** through **The Yogurt Hydration Pattern**. By using Greek yogurt as the primary binder, we create a dense, custardy "Bounce" that mimics pie filling without the need for excessive oil. We maintain **Texture Integrity** by using **The Silver Dollar Pattern**: small, 2-tablespoon pancakes ensure the diced peaches are distributed evenly and the pancake cooks through before the fruit releases too much moisture. The cinnamon provides the mandatory aromatic **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a separate bowl, whisk yogurt, milk, vanilla, and melted butter until perfectly smooth.
3.  **Combine:** Gradually add the dry mix to the wet in 4 parts. Stir with a spatula until **just incorporated**. Small lumps are mandatory for a light texture.
4.  **Fold:** Gently fold in the diced peaches.
5.  **Prep:** Heat a non-stick skillet over **low-medium** heat (crucial for whole wheat). Lightly grease with oil spray.
6.  **Pour:** Drop 2-tbsp portions onto the skillet. Cook for 2-3 minutes until bubbles form and the edges look set.
7.  **Flip:** Flip gently and cook for 1-2 more minutes until golden brown.
8.  **Serve:** Serve with warm maple syrup and a few extra fresh peach slices.
