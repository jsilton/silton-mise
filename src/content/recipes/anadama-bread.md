## Chef's Note

Anadama is a quintessential New England bread, supposedly named after a fisherman's wife named Anna. The bread is defined by the bittersweet depth of molasses and the rustic texture of cornmeal. The secret is the cornmeal porridge: you must cook the cornmeal in water first to hydrate the starch, ensuring the bread stays moist rather than gritty. This traditional keeper pairs perfectly with salted butter or a bowl of chowder.

## Directions

1.  **The Porridge:** In a small saucepan, whisk 1/2 cup water and cornmeal. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly for 5 minutes until thickened. Remove from heat.
2.  **Melt:** Stir in the butter and molasses. Let cool until lukewarm (critical—if too hot, it will kill the yeast).
3.  **The Yeast:** In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes until foamy.
4.  **The Dough:** Stir the cornmeal mixture into the yeast. Add 2 cups of flour and the salt. Gradually add the remaining flour until a shaggy dough forms.
5.  **Knead:** Turn out onto a floured surface. Knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. The dough should be slightly tacky but not sticky.
6.  **Rise 1:** Place in an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm spot until doubled (about 1 hour).
7.  **Shape:** Deflate the dough. Shape into a loaf and place in a greased 9x5 pan.
8.  **Rise 2:** Cover and let rise again until doubled (about 45 minutes).
9.  **Bake:** Bake at 375°F for 30 minutes until the top is dark golden brown and the bottom sounds hollow when tapped.
