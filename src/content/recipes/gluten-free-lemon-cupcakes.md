## Directions

1. For the cupcakes: Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a 12-serving cupcake pan with paper liners; set aside.
2. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside.
3. In a large mixing bowl, with an electric beater, beat oil and sugar for one minute. Add eggs one at a time, beating in between each egg. Stir in vanilla extract, lemon juice, and lemon zest.
4. Add the flour mixture and milk to the wet ingredients and mix just till combined. Don’t over mix!
5. Divide batter among liners, filling ⅔ full (about ¼ cup of batter per cupcake).
6. Bake for 18-20 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean.
7. Cool completely before frosting.
8. For the frosting: Beat butter until creamy. Add lemon juice or extract and beat till combined. Beat in 1 cup of powdered sugar at a time until it’s all added, alternating with 1 tablespoon of milk. Add more or less milk for desired consistency.
9. Store cupcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to four days.
