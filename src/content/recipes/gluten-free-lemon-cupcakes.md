## Chef's Note

The challenge with gluten-free baking is preventing a gritty or dry texture. We solve this with **Culinary Technique** through **The Emulsion Beat Method**: we beat the oil and sugar for a full minute _before_ adding eggs, which creates a stable fat-sugar network that traps moisture. The **Acid Balance** is doubled here: we use both juice and zest in the batter, then finish with a sharp lemon buttercream. This provides the mandatory "High Note" that ensures the cupcakes taste fresh rather than heavy.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** Whisk together GF flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a large bowl, beat the oil and sugar with an electric mixer for 1 minute. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each. Stir in vanilla, lemon juice, and zest.
3.  **Combine:** Gradually add the flour mixture and milk. Mix until **just combined**—GF flour doesn't develop gluten, but over-mixing can still lead to a gummy "Bounce."
4.  **Bake:** Divide batter among 12 lined cups (about 2/3 full). Bake at 350°F for 18-20 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean.
5.  **Cool:** Let cool **completely** before frosting. GF cakes are structurally fragile while warm.
6.  **The Frosting:** Beat butter until creamy. Add lemon juice and 1 cup of sugar. Beat until smooth. Gradually add remaining sugar and milk until the frosting holds a stiff peak.
7.  **Finish:** Frost generously. Store in an airtight container for up to 4 days.
