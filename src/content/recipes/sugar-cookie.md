## Chef's Note

These are classic sugar cookies for holiday baking. The secret to crisp edges is sifting the flour, salt, and baking powder together; this breaks up any starch clumps and ensures a uniform, delicate crumb. Refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours until stone-cold before rolling; this prevents the butter from melting too quickly, resulting in a cookie that holds its sharp edges.

## Directions

1.  **The Dry Mix:** Sift flour, salt, and baking powder into a medium bowl. (Mandatory for texture).
2.  **Cream:** In a stand mixer, beat softened butter and sugar for 2 minutes until light and airy. Add eggs one at a time, then vanilla.
3.  **Incorporate:** Gradually add the dry mix until a clean dough forms. **Do not over-mix.**
4.  **The Chill:** Divide dough into two disks. Wrap tightly in plastic and **refrigerate for at least 2 hours**.
5.  **Shape:** Preheat oven to 375°F. On a floured surface, roll dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut into shapes.
6.  **Bake:** Place 1 inch apart on parchment. Bake for 10-12 minutes until the very edges are just beginning to turn golden brown.
7.  **The Finish:** Let cool on the pan for 5 minutes to ensure a crispy base. Serve plain or decorate with [Royal Icing](/silton-mise/recipes/royal-icing).
