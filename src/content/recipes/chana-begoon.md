## Chef's Note

This Indian chickpea and eggplant curry keeps the eggplant from turning mushy by roasting it separately at 425°F until browned and tender, then folding it into the gravy at the end. Chinese eggplant works especially well because it's less watery than globe eggplant. Lemon juice stirred in at the finish brightens the spiced tomato gravy.

## Directions

1.  **Roast Eggplant:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss eggplant cubes with oil and salt. Roast on a sheet pan for 15-20 minutes until golden and tender. Set aside.
2.  **The Gravy:** In a large skillet, sauté the onion until deep golden brown (10 mins). Add ginger and garlic; sauté for 2 minutes.
3.  **Bloom:** Add all dry spices and the crushed tomatoes. Simmer for 10 minutes until the oil starts to separate from the sauce.
4.  **Chickpeas:** Stir in the chickpeas and a splash of water. Simmer for 5 minutes.
5.  **Fold:** Gently fold the roasted eggplant into the gravy. Let it sit for 2 minutes to absorb the spices (do not over-stir).
6.  **Finish:** Stir in the cilantro and lemon juice.
