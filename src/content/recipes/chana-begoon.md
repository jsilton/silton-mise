## Chef's Note

The tragedy of eggplant curry is the "mush." We solve this with the **Silton Texture Pattern**: we **Roast** the eggplant cubes at high heat (425°F) separately until they are browned and meaty, adding them to the chickpea gravy only at the very end. This ensures the eggplant holds its shape and provides a satisfying "bite" that rivals meat. Always finish with a squeeze of lemon to provide the **Acid Finish**.

## Directions

1.  **Roast Eggplant:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss eggplant cubes with oil and salt. Roast on a sheet pan for 15-20 minutes until golden and tender. Set aside.
2.  **The Gravy:** In a large skillet, sauté the onion until deep golden brown (10 mins). Add ginger and garlic; sauté for 2 minutes.
3.  **Bloom:** Add all dry spices and the crushed tomatoes. Simmer for 10 minutes until the oil starts to separate from the sauce.
4.  **Chickpeas:** Stir in the chickpeas and a splash of water. Simmer for 5 minutes.
5.  **Fold:** Gently fold the roasted eggplant into the gravy. Let it sit for 2 minutes to absorb the spices (do not over-stir).
6.  **Finish:** Stir in the cilantro and lemon juice.
