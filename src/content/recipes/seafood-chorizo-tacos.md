## Chef's Note

This is a masterclass in **Texture Integrity**. The secret to the Silton Standard is **The Protein Hierarchy Pattern**: we sear the chorizo first to render its spicy orange fat, then flash-fry the delicate shrimp and squid in that same fat. This ensures the seafood has a smoky "Snap" without overcooking. We use a splash of **Mexican Lager** as the "Deep Note" to deglaze the pan—the maltiness bridges the gap between the spicy pork and the sweet seafood. The lime juice provides the mandatory **Acid Finish**.

## Directions

1.  **The Render:** In a large skillet, heat 1 tbsp oil. Add chorizo. Cook over high heat for 4 minutes, breaking it up until crispy and the fat is released.
2.  **Aromatics:** Add the onion, garlic, and cumin. Sauté for 2 minutes until soft.
3.  **The Snap:** Add the shrimp, squid, and lager to the skillet. Toss vigorously over **moderately high** heat for exactly 3 minutes until the seafood is opaque. **Do not overcook.**
4.  **Finish:** Stir in the lime juice. Remove from heat. Season with salt and pepper.
5.  **Assemble:** Warm corn tortillas over an open flame until charred.
6.  **Serve:** Fill each tortilla with the seafood-chorizo mix. Top with sliced avocado and cilantro for the final **High Note**.
