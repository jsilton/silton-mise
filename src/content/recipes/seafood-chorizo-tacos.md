## Chef's Note

These Mexican-style tacos combine spicy chorizo with delicate seafood by rendering the chorizo first to release its spicy orange fat, then quickly cooking shrimp and squid in that same fat. This infuses the seafood with smoky flavor without overcooking. A splash of Mexican lager deglazes the pan, and lime juice adds brightness.

## Directions

1.  **The Render:** In a large skillet, heat 1 tbsp oil. Add chorizo. Cook over high heat for 4 minutes, breaking it up until crispy and the fat is released.
2.  **Aromatics:** Add the onion, garlic, and cumin. Sauté for 2 minutes until soft.
3.  **The Crunch:** Add the shrimp, squid, and lager to the skillet. Toss vigorously over **moderately high** heat for exactly 3 minutes until the seafood is opaque. **Do not overcook.**
4.  **Finish:** Stir in the lime juice. Remove from heat. Season with salt and pepper.
5.  **Assemble:** Warm corn tortillas over an open flame until charred.
6.  **Serve:** Fill each tortilla with the seafood-chorizo mix. Top with sliced avocado and cilantro for the final **High Note**.
