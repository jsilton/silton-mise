## Chef's Note

This isn't your average kale salad. The secret to making kale "Restaurant Quality" is the **Massage**: by rubbing the shredded leaves with a little oil and salt, you break down the tough fibers, turning the leaves tender and sweet. The dressing uses the natural fat of the avocado combined with a hit of **Miso or Soy** to create that deep, savory "Caesar" punch without needing raw eggs or anchovies.

## Directions

1.  **Massaging the Kale:** Place the shredded kale in a large bowl. Drizzle with 1 tsp olive oil and a pinch of salt. Using your hands, massage the leaves vigorously for 2 minutes until they turn dark green and soften significantly.
2.  **The Dressing:** In a blender or small food processor, combine half of the avocado, water, mayo (if using), garlic, lemon juice, Dijon, and miso/soy. Blend until completely smooth. Adjust water until it reaches a "heavy cream" consistency.
3.  **Toss:** Pour the dressing over the massaged kale. Toss well to ensure every leaf is coated.
4.  **Texture:** Add the toasted pepitas and half of the Parmesan. Toss again.
5.  **Assemble:** Top with the remaining half of the avocado (diced), the rest of the Parmesan, and the toasted panko (if using).
6.  **Rest:** Let the salad sit for 5 minutes before serving—kale is sturdy and actually improves as it absorbs the dressing.
