## Chef's Note

The secret to exceptional Belgian waffles is beating the egg whites to stiff peaks separately and folding them into the batter at the very end. This introduces millions of tiny air pockets that expand instantly in the waffle iron, creating a shatteringly crisp exterior with a cloud-like interior. We use a higher ratio of baking powder to ensure the vertical rise needed for deep Belgian pockets.

## Directions

1.  **Aeration:** In a clean bowl, beat the 2 egg whites until stiff peaks form. Set aside.
2.  **Dry Mix:** Sift together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl.
3.  **The Emulsion:** In a separate bowl, whisk together egg yolks, milk, oil, and vanilla until smooth.
4.  **Combine:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Stir with a whisk until **just combined** (small lumps are mandatory).
5.  **The Fold:** Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the batter using a rubber spatula. Do not over-mix, or you will deflate the "Bounce."
6.  **Bake:** Pour 1/2 cup portions into a preheated, oiled waffle iron. Cook for 5-7 minutes until deep golden brown and the steam stops.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with warm maple syrup and [Perfect Cranberry Sauce](/mise/recipes/perfect-cranberry-sauce).
