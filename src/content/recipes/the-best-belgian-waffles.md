## Chef's Note

The secret to a "Kitchen Standard" waffle is **Culinary Technique** through **The Cloud Aeration Method**. You must beat the egg whites to stiff peaks _separately_ and fold them into the batter at the very end. This introduces millions of tiny air pockets that expand instantly in the waffle iron, creating a shatteringly crisp Crunch on the exterior with a cloud-like Texture inside. We use a **High Baking Powder Ratio** to ensure the vertical rise needed for deep Belgian pockets.

## Directions

1.  **Aeration:** In a clean bowl, beat the 2 egg whites until stiff peaks form. Set aside.
2.  **Dry Mix:** Sift together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl.
3.  **The Emulsion:** In a separate bowl, whisk together egg yolks, milk, oil, and vanilla until smooth.
4.  **Combine:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Stir with a whisk until **just combined** (small lumps are mandatory).
5.  **The Fold:** Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the batter using a rubber spatula. Do not over-mix, or you will deflate the "Bounce."
6.  **Bake:** Pour 1/2 cup portions into a preheated, oiled waffle iron. Cook for 5-7 minutes until deep golden brown and the steam stops.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with warm maple syrup and [Perfect Cranberry Sauce](/silton-mise/recipes/perfect-cranberry-sauce).
