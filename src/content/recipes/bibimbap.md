## Chef's Note

Bibimbap has roots in Korean royal court cuisine but became a peasant dish in the Joseon Dynasty, when farmers would mix leftover vegetables and rice in a bowl. The name means 'mixed rice,' and it reflects the Korean philosophy of balance - multiple flavors and textures coming together in harmony. In Jeonju, the dish is so revered there's an annual Bibimbap Festival. The magic moment is when you break the runny egg yolk and stir everything together, creating a creamy sauce that coats the rice.

## Critical Components

This dish relies on having several prepared sides ("Banchan") ready to assemble. Use these recipes or store-bought alternatives:

*   **The Meat:** [Korean Marinated Ribeye](/mise/recipes/marinated-korean-ribeye) (Bulgogi)
*   **The Crunch:** [Korean Pickled Cucumbers](/mise/recipes/korean-pickled-cucumbers) (Oi Muchim)
*   **The Green:** [Seasoned Spinach](/mise/recipes/simply-seasoned-korean-spinach-salad) (Sigeumchi Namul)
*   **The Sprout:** [Seasoned Bean Sprouts](/mise/recipes/seasoned-bean-sprouts) (Kongnamul)
*   **The Rice:** [Short Grain Rice](/mise/recipes/steamed-white-rice) (must be hot!)

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Have all your component recipes ready ([Ribeye](/mise/recipes/marinated-korean-ribeye), [Cucumbers](/mise/recipes/korean-pickled-cucumbers), etc.).
2.  **Base:** Scoop 1 cup of hot rice into each bowl. (Tip: For crispy rice, use the "Cast Iron Skillet Hack" mentioned in the [Ribeye](/mise/recipes/marinated-korean-ribeye) recipe).
3.  **The Clock:** Arrange the prepared vegetables and meat in distinct piles around the perimeter of the bowl, moving clockwise.
4.  **The Crown:** Place the fried egg in the center.
5.  **Sauce:** Drizzle the mixed Gochujang sauce over the egg.
6.  **Serve:** Mix vigorously before eating.
