Bibimbap simply translates to “mixed rice with meat and assorted vegetables“. You can make endless variations to this dish depending on your preference and dietary requirements (e.g. Microgreens Bibimbap) and also based on the dish/bowl it is served in (e.g. Dolsot Bibimbap and Yangpun Bibimbap).More traditional and authentic versions of Bibimbap are served with raw beef and raw egg yolk along with other vegetables but I prefer making it with cooked ingredients.As I was growing up, my mum used make Bibimbap to get rid of vegetable side dishes (banchan) that are getting a few days old (less fresh) or when she didn’t want to put much effort into a meal, she would just take out a few sautéed and seasoned vegetables and Kimchi from the fridge, add a sprinkle of seasoned seaweed strips and made vegetarian Bibimbap.So I don’t recall having much nicely presented Bibimbap, like the top picture above at home, yet regardless of the presentation her Bibimbap was always tasty! Anyway, how do you make your Bibimbap? Any secret ingredients to share with us?I hope you enjoy my recipe!

## Directions

1. Prepare and cook ingredients as below.
2. For meat, mix the beef mince with the meat sauce listed above. Marinate the meat for about 30 mins while you are working on other ingredients to enhance the flavor. Add some cooking oil into a wok and cook the meat on medium high to high heat. It takes about 3 to 5 mins to thoroughly cook it.
3. Mix the Bibimbap sauce ingredients in a bowl.
4. Spinach and bean sprouts per linked recipe.
5. Rinse, peel and julienne the carrots. Add some cooking oil and 1/4 tsp of fine sea salt in a wok and cook the carrots on medium high to high heat for 2 to 3 mins.
6. Clean/rinse the shiitake mushrooms and thinly slice them. Add some cooking oil and 1/4 tsp of fine sea salt in a wok and cook the mushrooms on medium high to high heat until they are all cooked. (It takes 2 to 3 mins.)
7. Make fried eggs. (While sunny side up is common, you can make them per your preference.)
8. Put the rice into a bowl and add the meat, assorted vegetables, seasoned seaweed, Bibimbap sauce and the egg on top of the rice. Serve it.
9. Mix the ingredients well in the bowl and enjoy!
