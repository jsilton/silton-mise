## Chef's Note

Bibimbap is not a single recipe; it is an assembly of masterpieces. By preparing each component individually, you ensure that every bite has a distinct personality. The "Magic Moment" happens when you break the sunny-side-up yolk and stir everything together with the Gochujang sauce—the yolk and oil emulsify into a rich, spicy cream that coats the rice.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Have all your component recipes ready ([Ribeye](/silton-mise/recipes/marinated-korean-ribeye), [Cucumbers](/silton-mise/recipes/korean-pickled-cucumbers), etc.).
2.  **Base:** Scoop 1 cup of hot rice into each bowl. (Tip: For crispy rice, use the "Cast Iron Skillet Hack" mentioned in the [Ribeye](/silton-mise/recipes/marinated-korean-ribeye) recipe).
3.  **The Clock:** Arrange the prepared vegetables and meat in distinct piles around the perimeter of the bowl, moving clockwise.
4.  **The Crown:** Place the fried egg in the center.
5.  **Sauce:** Drizzle the mixed Gochujang sauce over the egg.
6.  **Serve:** Mix vigorously before eating.
