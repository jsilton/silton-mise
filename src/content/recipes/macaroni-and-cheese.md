## Chef's Note

This is a Southern-style **Custard Mac and Cheese** with a pimento-infused twist. Unlike the stove-top version which uses a flour-based roux, this version uses eggs and milk to create a rich, souffle-like binder that sets in the oven. The result is a dish that is deeply comforting and sliceable. The secret is to **shred your own cheese** from a block; pre-shredded cheese is coated in potato starch which prevents a silky melt.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta for 2 minutes **less** than the package instructions (it should be very firm). Drain and return to the pot.
2.  **Butter:** Toss the hot pasta with the melted butter until evenly coated. This creates a barrier that prevents the pasta from getting mushy in the sauce.
3.  **Mix:** In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, pepper, garlic powder, mustard powder, and smoked paprika.
4.  **Combine:** Add 3/4 of the shredded cheese and all of the chopped pimentos to the pasta. Pour the egg/milk mixture over the top and stir gently until everything is combined.
5.  **Bake:** Transfer the mixture to a greased 9x13 baking dish. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top.
6.  **Crisp:** Bake for 25-30 minutes until the top is golden brown and the edges are bubbling. For an extra-crispy top, broil for the final 60 seconds.
7.  **Rest:** Let the dish stand for 5 minutes before serving. This allows the custard to set.
