## Chef's Note

Paella is not a "stir-fry." The soul of this dish is the **Socarrat**: the layer of toasted, crispy rice at the bottom of the pan. The secret is to **STOP STIRRING** once the rice is in the liquid. You want the rice to absorb the broth and then fry in the rendered chorizo fat at the very bottom. Listen for the "crackle"—that is the sound of success.

## Directions

1.  **Chorizo:** In a large wide skillet (paella pan or cast iron), sear the chorizo rounds until crispy. Remove to a plate.
2.  **Sofrito:** In the same fat, sauté the onion and bell pepper until soft (8 mins). Stir in the garlic, pimentón, and tomato puree. Cook for 5 minutes until it becomes a thick, dark jam.
3.  **The Rice:** Add the rice to the pan. Stir for 2 minutes to toast the grains in the sofrito.
4.  **Simmer:** Add the saffron to the warm broth. Pour the broth over the rice. Shake the pan to distribute the rice evenly. **DO NOT STIR AGAIN.**
5.  **Cook:** Simmer over medium-low heat for 15 minutes until the liquid is almost gone.
6.  **Proteins:** Press the raw shrimp and seared chorizo into the surface of the rice.
7.  **The Socarrat:** Increase heat to medium-high for the final 2 minutes. Listen for a "crackling" sound. This is the bottom crisping.
8.  **Rest:** Turn off the heat. Cover with a clean towel and let rest for 5 minutes.
9.  **Finish:** Garnish with parsley and lots of lemon.
