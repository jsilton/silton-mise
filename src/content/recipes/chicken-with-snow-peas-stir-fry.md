## Chef's Note

The secret to this 25-minute quick meal is the **Culinary Technique** of **Velveting** and **High-Heat Folding**. By marinating the chicken in a cornstarch-oil-soy mixture, we create a barrier that keeps the breast meat juicy in the wok. We maintain **Textural Balance** by using a "bottom-to-top" folding motion—this ensures the snow peas stay bright green and perfectly crispy rather than steaming into a limp yellow mess.

## Directions

1.  **Velvet:** Toss chicken strips with the marinade ingredients. Let sit for 10 minutes.
2.  **Prep:** Whisk the stock and cornstarch into a slurry. Set aside.
3.  **Sear:** Heat a wok over high heat until smoking. Add 1 tbsp oil. Spread chicken in a single layer and let sear undisturbed for 60 seconds.
4.  **Toss:** Stir the chicken. Add garlic and snow peas. Splash the Shaoxing wine around the rim of the wok to deglaze.
5.  **Fold:** Use a spatula to fold the peas and chicken for 30 seconds. Add soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and white pepper.
6.  **Glaze:** Give the slurry a final stir and pour it into the wok. Stir-fry for 30 more seconds until the sauce is glossy and the peas are bright green.
7.  **Serve:** Plate immediately over steamed rice.
