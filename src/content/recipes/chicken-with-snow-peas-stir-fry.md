## Chef's Note

Chicken with snow peas is a classic Cantonese stir-fry showcasing fresh spring vegetables. Marinating the chicken in cornstarch, soy, and oil ("velveting") keeps the lean breast meat tender over high heat. The key is using quick, high-heat cooking and minimal stirring so the snow peas stay bright green and crisp instead of becoming limp and yellowed. The light sauce should be glossy and barely coat the ingredients.

## Directions

1.  **Velvet:** Toss chicken strips with the marinade ingredients. Let sit for 10 minutes.
2.  **Prep:** Whisk the stock and cornstarch into a slurry. Set aside.
3.  **Sear:** Heat a wok over high heat until smoking. Add 1 tbsp oil. Spread chicken in a single layer and let sear undisturbed for 60 seconds.
4.  **Toss:** Stir the chicken. Add garlic and snow peas. Splash the Shaoxing wine around the rim of the wok to deglaze.
5.  **Fold:** Use a spatula to fold the peas and chicken for 30 seconds. Add soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and white pepper.
6.  **Glaze:** Give the slurry a final stir and pour it into the wok. Stir-fry for 30 more seconds until the sauce is glossy and the peas are bright green.
7.  **Serve:** Plate immediately over steamed rice.
