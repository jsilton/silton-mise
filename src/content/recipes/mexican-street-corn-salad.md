## Chef's Note

The secret to restaurant-quality corn salad is the **Maillard Reaction**. Don't just boil the corn; sear the kernels in a smoking hot pan (or grill them on the cob) until they are deeply charred and "popping." This provides a nutty sweetness that balances the creamy dressing and the sharp acidity of the lime. This is the **Textural Balance** pattern in action.

## Directions

1.  **The Sear:** Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Add the corn in a single layer. Let it cook undisturbed for 2-3 minutes until charred. Toss and cook for another 2 minutes. Remove to a bowl.
2.  **The Mix:** In a small bowl, whisk together the mayo, cheese, chili powder, and garlic.
3.  **Toss:** Add the creamy mixture to the warm corn. Toss to coat evenly.
4.  **Finish:** Stir in the cilantro, green onions, and lime juice.
5.  **Serve:** Serve warm or chilled.
