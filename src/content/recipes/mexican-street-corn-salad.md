## Chef's Note

Esquites is a Mexican street food where corn kernels are charred or grilled until deeply caramelized, then tossed with lime, mayo, cotija cheese, and chili powder. Searing the kernels in a hot pan until they develop dark, charred spots creates nutty sweetness that balances the creamy dressing and sharp lime.

## Directions

1.  **The Sear:** Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Add the corn in a single layer. Let it cook undisturbed for 2-3 minutes until charred. Toss and cook for another 2 minutes. Remove to a bowl.
2.  **The Mix:** In a small bowl, whisk together the mayo, cheese, chili powder, and garlic.
3.  **Toss:** Add the creamy mixture to the warm corn. Toss to coat evenly.
4.  **Finish:** Stir in the cilantro, green onions, and lime juice.
5.  **Serve:** Serve warm or chilled.
