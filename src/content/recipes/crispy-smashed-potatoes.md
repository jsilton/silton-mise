## Chef's Note

Boiling potatoes until tender, then smashing them flat creates jagged edges and crannies. Roasting at 425°F crisps these edges beautifully while the interior stays fluffy. Let smashed potatoes sit for 5 minutes before oiling so surface moisture evaporates.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Place whole baby potatoes in a pot of cold salted water. Bring to a boil and cook for 15-20 minutes until easily pierced with a fork. Drain.
2.  **Smash:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Place potatoes on the sheet. Use the bottom of a heavy glass or a potato masher to press each potato until it is about 1/2-inch thick. **Do not over-smash**; you want them to stay in one piece.
3.  **Dry:** Let the smashed potatoes sit for 5 minutes to allow surface moisture to evaporate.
4.  **Season:** Drizzle generously with oil. Sprinkle with garlic powder, herbs, salt, and pepper.
5.  **Roast:** Bake for 25-30 minutes, flipping once halfway through, until the potatoes are deep golden brown and the edges are "glass-crisp."
6.  **Finish:** Sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Serve hot.
