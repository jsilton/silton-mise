## Chef's Note

This dish is an exercise in **Maximizing Surface Area**. By boiling the potatoes until tender and then smashing them flat, we create dozens of jagged edges and crannies. When roasted at high heat, these edges become shatteringly crisp while the interior remains fluffy. This is the **Kitchen Standard** for roasted potatoes.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Place whole baby potatoes in a pot of cold salted water. Bring to a boil and cook for 15-20 minutes until easily pierced with a fork. Drain.
2.  **Smash:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Place potatoes on the sheet. Use the bottom of a heavy glass or a potato masher to press each potato until it is about 1/2-inch thick. **Do not over-smash**; you want them to stay in one piece.
3.  **Dry:** Let the smashed potatoes sit for 5 minutes to allow surface moisture to evaporate.
4.  **Season:** Drizzle generously with oil. Sprinkle with garlic powder, herbs, salt, and pepper.
5.  **Roast:** Bake for 25-30 minutes, flipping once halfway through, until the potatoes are deep golden brown and the edges are "glass-crisp."
6.  **Finish:** Sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Serve hot.
