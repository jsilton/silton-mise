## Chef's Note

Raita is the essential cooling side for spicy Indian dishes. To achieve the **Kitchen Standard** for texture, you must **Grate and Squeeze** the cucumber. Skipping this step results in a watery sauce that dilutes the flavor of your curry. By removing the excess water, the yogurt stays thick and luscious.

## Directions

1.  **Grate:** Grate the cucumber (skin on) using the large holes of a box grater.
2.  **Squeeze:** Place the grated cucumber in a clean kitchen towel. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Let sit for 2 minutes, then **squeeze vigorously** until bone-dry.
3.  **Mix:** In a bowl, whisk the yogurt until smooth. Stir in the squeezed cucumber, cilantro, cumin, salt, and sugar.
4.  **Finish:** Taste and adjust salt. Let sit for 10 minutes in the fridge before serving to let the flavors meld.
