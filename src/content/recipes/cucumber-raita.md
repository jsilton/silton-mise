## Chef's Note

Raita is the essential cooling side for spicy Indian dishes. Grating and squeezing cucumber removes excess water that would otherwise make the yogurt watery and dilute curry flavors. Toasted cumin seeds add warm, earthy depth to the cool yogurt base.

## Directions

1.  **Grate:** Grate the cucumber (skin on) using the large holes of a box grater.
2.  **Squeeze:** Place the grated cucumber in a clean kitchen towel. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Let sit for 2 minutes, then **squeeze vigorously** until bone-dry.
3.  **Mix:** In a bowl, whisk the yogurt until smooth. Stir in the squeezed cucumber, cilantro, cumin, salt, and sugar.
4.  **Finish:** Taste and adjust salt. Let sit for 10 minutes in the fridge before serving to let the flavors meld.
