## Chef's Note

These no-bake bites prep in bulk for lunchboxes, pre-workout snacks, or yogurt toppings. Different protein powders absorb liquid at varying rates, so add milk one teaspoon at a time until dough reaches fresh brownie consistency. Chilling sets the almond butter's healthy fats so balls hold their shape.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a medium bowl, combine almond butter, protein powder, almond flour, cocoa powder, maple syrup, and sea salt.
2.  **Hydrate:** Mix with a spatula until a thick dough forms. If it is too crumbly to hold a shape, add 1 tbsp of water or milk. If it's still too dry, add another tbsp.
3.  **Texture:** Fold in the flaxseed (or chia) and the mini chocolate chips.
4.  **Roll:** Scoop out 1-tbsp portions and roll between your palms into balls.
5.  **Set:** Place on a plate and chill in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes before eating.
6.  **Store:** Keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.
