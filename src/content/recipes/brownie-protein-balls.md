## Directions

1. In a medium bowl, combine the almond butter, chocolate protein powder, almond flour, cocoa powder, maple syrup or honey, and a pinch of salt.
2. Mix everything together with a spatula until a thick dough starts to form. If the mixture seems too dry and crumbly, add the milk or water a little at a time until the dough is moist enough to stick together.
3. Once the dough has a good consistency, stir in the chia seeds or flax and the chocolate chips.
4. Use a spoon or your hands to scoop out small portions of the dough and roll them into balls.
5. Place the finished balls on a plate or tray and chill them in the refrigerator for at least 15-20 minutes to help them set.
