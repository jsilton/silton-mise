## Chef's Note

These are the ultimate **Modularity** component. We treat these as a "Base" because they can be prepped in bulk and added to lunchboxes, pre-workout stacks, or crumbled over yogurt. The secret to the Kitchen Standard is the **Hydration Balance**: protein powder absorbs liquid at different rates, so we add the milk one teaspoon at a time until the dough has the Texture of a fresh brownie. Chilling is mandatory to set the healthy fats from the almond butter, ensuring they hold their shape.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a medium bowl, combine almond butter, protein powder, almond flour, cocoa powder, maple syrup, and sea salt.
2.  **Hydrate:** Mix with a spatula until a thick dough forms. If it is too crumbly to hold a shape, add 1 tbsp of water or milk. If it's still too dry, add another tbsp.
3.  **Texture:** Fold in the flaxseed (or chia) and the mini chocolate chips.
4.  **Roll:** Scoop out 1-tbsp portions and roll between your palms into balls.
5.  **Set:** Place on a plate and chill in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes before eating.
6.  **Store:** Keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.
