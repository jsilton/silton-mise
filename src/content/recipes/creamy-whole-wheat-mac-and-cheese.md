## Chef's Note

This is our **Updated Classic** version of the blue-box classic, re-engineered for nutritious performance with whole-wheat pasta. The secret to the Kitchen Standard is **The Starch Bind Method**: we don't drain the pasta bone-dry; instead, we combine the hot noodles directly with butter and cream to create a natural emulsion. By using **Freshly Grated Cheddar**, we avoid the stabilizers in pre-shredded bags, resulting in a Texture that is far superior to any processed version. A pinch of **Nutmeg** provides the mandatory "High Note" that bridges the earthy wheat and rich cream.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook macaroni in salted water until **al dente**. Drain, but do not rinse—you want the surface starch to remain.
2.  **Melt:** Return the hot noodles to the pot. Add the butter and 1/3 cup of cream. Stir over medium-low heat until the butter is completely melted and coating the pasta.
3.  **Bind:** Turn the heat to low. Add the Cheddar and Parmesan one handful at a time, stirring constantly until the cheese has melted into a silky, thick sauce.
4.  **Finish:** Stir in the final tablespoon of cream, salt, plenty of black pepper, and the pinch of nutmeg.
5.  **Serve:** Serve immediately while the sauce is at its glossiest.
