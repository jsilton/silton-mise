## Chef's Note

This is a high-speed, one-pot wonder. To solve the "Mushy Veggie" problem, we use **Textural Balance**: instead of simmering the broccolini in the broth with the pasta, we sauté it hard first to get charred edges and then set it aside, adding it back only at the very end. This keeps the veg snappy and the orzo creamy.

## Directions

1.  **The Sear:** Heat oil in a large skillet. Brown the sausage rounds for 3-4 minutes. Remove to a plate.
2.  **The Veg:** Add broccolini to the same pan. Sauté over high heat for 5 minutes until charred and tender-crisp. Remove and keep with the sausage.
3.  **The Toast:** Add the orzo and garlic to the pan. Toast for 1 minute until the orzo smells nutty.
4.  **The Simmer:** Pour in the broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low and cover. Simmer for 10 minutes until liquid is absorbed and pasta is al dente.
5.  **The Fold:** Stir in the Parmesan, the reserved sausage, and the broccolini.
6.  **Finish:** If the pasta is too dry, add a splash of hot water. Season with plenty of black pepper.
