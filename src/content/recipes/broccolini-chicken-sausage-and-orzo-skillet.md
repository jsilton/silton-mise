## Chef's Note

This is a modern Mediterranean-inspired one-pot meal that uses the risotto technique - toasting the orzo first, then cooking it in broth so it absorbs maximum flavor. Orzo is actually a pasta shaped like rice, invented in Italy but hugely popular in Greek cooking. Broccolini is a hybrid of broccoli and Chinese kale, developed in 1993, with a sweeter, more delicate flavor than regular broccoli. The key to not ending up with mushy vegetables is sautéing the broccolini separately first to get some char, then folding it in at the end.

## Directions

1.  **The Sear:** Heat oil in a large skillet. Brown the sausage rounds for 3-4 minutes. Remove to a plate.
2.  **The Veg:** Add broccolini to the same pan. Sauté over high heat for 5 minutes until charred and tender-crisp. Remove and keep with the sausage.
3.  **The Toast:** Add the orzo and garlic to the pan. Toast for 1 minute until the orzo smells nutty.
4.  **The Simmer:** Pour in the broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low and cover. Simmer for 10 minutes until liquid is absorbed and pasta is al dente.
5.  **The Fold:** Stir in the Parmesan, the reserved sausage, and the broccolini.
6.  **Finish:** If the pasta is too dry, add a splash of hot water. Season with plenty of black pepper.
