title: 'Broccolini, Chicken Sausage, and Orzo Skillet'
servings: Serves 4
ingredients:
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - >-
    8 ounces fully cooked hot Italian chicken sausage, cut into 1/4-inch-thick
    rounds
  - '2 bunches Broccolini (about 1 pound), coarsely chopped'
  - Kosher salt
  - Freshly ground black pepper

  - 1 cup orzo pasta (about 8 ounces)
  - 2 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
  - '1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for serving'

## Directions

1. Heat the oil in a 10-inch regular or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook until evenly browned on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the Broccolini, season with salt and pepper, and sauté until vibrant green and almost tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and orzo and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.
2. Add the chicken broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook until the pasta is al dente and the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes or according to your orzo's package instructions. (If the pasta is cooked before the liquid is completely absorbed, uncover the skillet and let it simmer for an extra minute to evaporate it.) Stir in the 1/2 cup of Parmesan and season as needed with salt and pepper. Garnish with additional grated cheese if desired.

## Notes

Storage: Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container and refrigerated for up to 3 days.
