## Chef's Note

This is a high-speed nutritious meal that relies on **Culinary Technique** for its creamy texture. We use **The Blender Method** to create a raw, cold emulsion of avocado and olive oil—this prevents the "split" that often happens with cooked avocado sauces. The **Lemon Juice** provides the mandatory **Acid Balance** while also stabilizing the chlorophyll in the basil and spinach, ensuring the sauce stays vibrant green. Never cook the sauce; the residual heat of the pasta is enough to warm it into a "Bounce."

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in a large pot of salted water until **al dente**. **Reserve 1 cup of pasta water** before draining.
2.  **The Emulsion:** While pasta boils, place avocado flesh, basil, spinach, garlic, lemon juice, and salt in a blender.
3.  **Blend:** Start blending on low. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil and 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water. Blend for 60 seconds until completely smooth and aerated.
4.  **Combine:** Place the hot, drained pasta in a large bowl. Pour the green sauce over the top and toss vigorously until the noodles are glossy and fully coated.
5.  **Adjust:** If the sauce is too thick, add a few more tablespoons of pasta water.
6.  **Serve:** Top immediately with halved cherry tomatoes and Parmesan for **Textural Balance**.
