## Chef's Note

This is a modern healthy fusion that became popular in the 2010s as avocados went mainstream in American cooking. It's not traditionally Italian - Italy doesn't grow avocados - but it uses Italian pasta techniques with California ingredients. The trick is blending raw avocado with olive oil to create a creamy cold sauce that stays smooth and doesn't separate. Lemon juice is critical for two reasons: it adds brightness and it prevents the avocado from turning brown by stabilizing the chlorophyll in the greens. Never cook the sauce - just let the hot pasta warm it. Eat immediately as avocado sauces don't hold well.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in a large pot of salted water until **al dente**. **Reserve 1 cup of pasta water** before draining.
2.  **The Emulsion:** While pasta boils, place avocado flesh, basil, spinach, garlic, lemon juice, and salt in a blender.
3.  **Blend:** Start blending on low. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil and 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water. Blend for 60 seconds until completely smooth and aerated.
4.  **Combine:** Place the hot, drained pasta in a large bowl. Pour the green sauce over the top and toss vigorously until the noodles are glossy and fully coated.
5.  **Adjust:** If the sauce is too thick, add a few more tablespoons of pasta water.
6.  **Serve:** Top immediately with halved cherry tomatoes and Parmesan for color and contrast.
