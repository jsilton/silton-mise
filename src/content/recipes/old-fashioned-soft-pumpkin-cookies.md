## Chef's Note
These are the baseline for autumn "Comfort." The secret to their incredible "Bounce" is **Structural Science** through **The Hydration Pattern**: pumpkin puree adds significant weight; by whisking it directly into the creamed butter and sugar, we ensure the moisture is fully emulsified before the flour is added. We finish with a **Butter-Sugar Glaze** to provide the mandatory "High Note" of sweetness that balances the earthy spices. Do not over-bake; these cookies should be "Shatteringly Soft."

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** Whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and spices.
2.  **Cream:** In a large bowl, beat softened butter and sugar until fluffy. Add the pumpkin, egg, and vanilla; beat until smooth.
3.  **Combine:** Gradually add the dry mix until **just combined**. The batter will be very soft and scoopable.
4.  **Shape:** Drop by rounded tablespoons onto greased sheets.
5.  **Bake:** Bake at 350°F for 15-18 minutes until the edges are firm and the tops are slightly golden.
6.  **Glaze:** Whisk glaze ingredients until smooth. Drizzle over warm cookies.
7.  **Serve:** Let cool for 10 minutes to allow the glaze to set into a "Snap."
