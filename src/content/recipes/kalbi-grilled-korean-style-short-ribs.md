## Chef's Note

Kalbi is the ultimate expression of **Culinary Technique** in Korean barbecue. The secret to meat that is tender yet has a resilient Crunch is **The Sake-Sugar Rub Method**: you must rub the ribs with sake and sugar for 15 minutes _before_ adding the soy sauce. This allows the alcohol and large sugar crystals to penetrate the tough flanken-style fibers, ensuring a succulent "Bounce." We use **The High-Heat Char Method**: grilling directly over charcoal for exactly 2 minutes per side to develop the mandatory smoky lacquer that defines the Kitchen Standard.

## Directions

1.  **The Prep:** Rinse the ribs in cold water to remove any bone fragments. Pat **bone-dry** with paper towels.
2.  **The Tenderizer:** In a large bowl, toss the ribs with the sake and white sugar. Massage the mixture into the meat and let stand for 15 minutes.
3.  **The Marinade:** In a separate jar, whisk together the soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, garlic, scallions, pepper, and oil until the sugar is dissolved.
4.  **The Soak:** Pour the marinade over the ribs. Ensure every slice is coated. Cover and refrigerate for **at least 8 hours** (overnight is mandatory for the Kitchen Standard).
5.  **Thermal Prep:** Bring the ribs to room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking. Discard the marinade.
6.  **The Sear:** Light a charcoal grill to high heat. Place ribs directly over the hottest coals. Grill for 2 minutes per side until seared and charred.
7.  **Finish:** Move to the cooler side of the grill for 5 minutes until the fat is rendered and "Snappy."
8.  **Serve:** Use kitchen shears to cut the ribs into bite-sized pieces.
