## Chef's Note

Kalbi is Korean barbecue short ribs. The secret to tender meat with crisp edges is rubbing the ribs with sake and sugar for 15 minutes before adding the soy sauce. This allows the alcohol and sugar crystals to penetrate the tough flanken-style fibers, ensuring succulent meat. Grill directly over charcoal for exactly 2 minutes per side to develop the smoky lacquered char.

## Directions

1.  **The Prep:** Rinse the ribs in cold water to remove any bone fragments. Pat **bone-dry** with paper towels.
2.  **The Tenderizer:** In a large bowl, toss the ribs with the sake and white sugar. Massage the mixture into the meat and let stand for 15 minutes.
3.  **The Marinade:** In a separate jar, whisk together the soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, garlic, scallions, pepper, and oil until the sugar is dissolved.
4.  **The Soak:** Pour the marinade over the ribs. Ensure every slice is coated. Cover and refrigerate for **at least 8 hours** (overnight is mandatory for the Kitchen Standard).
5.  **Thermal Prep:** Bring the ribs to room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking. Discard the marinade.
6.  **The Sear:** Light a charcoal grill to high heat. Place ribs directly over the hottest coals. Grill for 2 minutes per side until seared and charred.
7.  **Finish:** Move to the cooler side of the grill for 5 minutes until the fat is rendered and "Snappy."
8.  **Serve:** Use kitchen shears to cut the ribs into bite-sized pieces.
