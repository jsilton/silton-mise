## Chef's Note

This is our baseline **Modularity** component for standard pasta nights. We use **Culinary Technique** through **The Dough Hook Emulsion Method**: by utilizing the stand mixer, we develop the gluten chain with mechanical precision, ensuring a uniform Texture that hand-kneading can rarely achieve. The mandatory **Rest Cycle** (30-60 mins) is what allows the gluten to relax, ensuring the dough doesn't snap back while rolling.

## Directions

1.  **The Mix:** Place flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Create a well in the center. Add the eggs and olive oil.
2.  **The Hook:** Use the dough hook on speed 2. Run until a shaggy dough forms and starts to climb the hook (about 3-4 mins).
3.  **The Knead:** Continue on speed 2 for 8-10 minutes. The dough should transform from lumpy to completely smooth, elastic, and slightly tacky.
4.  **The Rest:** Remove from the bowl. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap. **Let rest for at least 30 minutes** (up to 24 hours in the fridge) before rolling.
5.  **Shape:** Cut, roll, and shape as desired. See [Fresh Egg Pasta](/silton-mise/recipes/fresh-egg-pasta) for rolling settings.
