## Chef's Note

This Mediterranean-style preparation uses two butter applications: one mixed with lemon and garlic pools beneath the fish to keep it moist, while butter-tossed panko on top creates a golden crust. Pat the cod completely dry before starting - any surface moisture prevents proper browning.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking dish with parchment or grease lightly. Pat the cod fillets with paper towels until completely dry.
2.  **The Base:** Whisk together 2 tbsp melted butter, lemon juice, 1 clove minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Pour this into the bottom of the baking dish. Place the fish on top.
3.  **the crunch:** In a small bowl, combine panko, the remaining 2 tbsp melted butter, lemon zest, the second garlic clove, paprika, and parsley.
4.  **Press:** Press the panko mixture firmly onto the top of each fillet to create an even, thick coating.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 12-15 minutes until the fish flakes easily with a fork and the panko is deep golden brown.
6.  **Serve:** Spoon some of the lemon butter from the pan over the fish just before serving.
