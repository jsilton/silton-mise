## Description

The secret to this recipe is the "Double Fat" layering. Drizzling lemon butter directly on the naked fish steams it from the bottom, while the buttered panko on top stays crispy.

## Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 400°F. Pat the fish very dry with paper towels.
2.  **The Base Layer:** Mix half the melted butter with the lemon juice, half the garlic, salt, and pepper. Pour this directly into the bottom of your baking dish. Place the fish on top.
3.  **The Crunch Layer:** In a small bowl, mix the panko, the remaining melted butter, lemon zest, remaining garlic, paprika, and parsley.
4.  Press the panko mixture firmly onto the top of each fillet.
5.  Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the fish flakes easily with a fork and the panko is golden.
