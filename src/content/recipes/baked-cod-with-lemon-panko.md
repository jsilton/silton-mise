## Chef's Note

The secret to this 25-minute meal is **Textural Balance** through our "Double Fat" layering technique. By drizzling a lemon-garlic butter directly onto the fish, we ensure it poaches gently from the bottom, staying succulent. Meanwhile, the second layer of buttered panko provides the Crunch on top. Always pat the fish **bone-dry** before starting—moisture is the enemy of a golden crust.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking dish with parchment or grease lightly. Pat the cod fillets with paper towels until completely dry.
2.  **The Base:** Whisk together 2 tbsp melted butter, lemon juice, 1 clove minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Pour this into the bottom of the baking dish. Place the fish on top.
3.  **the crunch:** In a small bowl, combine panko, the remaining 2 tbsp melted butter, lemon zest, the second garlic clove, paprika, and parsley.
4.  **Press:** Press the panko mixture firmly onto the top of each fillet to create an even, thick coating.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 12-15 minutes until the fish flakes easily with a fork and the panko is deep golden brown.
6.  **Serve:** Spoon some of the lemon butter from the pan over the fish just before serving.
