## Chef's Note
We have upgraded the old-school "pudding pie" to the **Modern Heritage** standard. The secret is the **Bittersweet High Note**: by using 70% cacao chocolate instead of milk chocolate, we create a sophisticated, intense filling that balances the sweetness of the sugar. We use **The Emulsion Pattern**: we whisk the egg yolks directly into the cold milk before cooking, ensuring a silky, custard-like "Bounce" that never turns grainy. For the best result, use the Vodka Hack crust from our [Apple Pie](/recipes/apple-pie).

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a medium saucepan, whisk together sugar, cornstarch, and salt. 
2.  **Emulsify:** Slowly whisk in the milk and egg yolks until the mixture is perfectly smooth.
3.  **The Cook:** Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for 6-8 minutes until the mixture just reaches a boil and becomes thick and glossy (like a heavy pudding).
4.  **The Melt:** Remove from heat immediately. Stir in the chopped bittersweet chocolate, butter, and vanilla. Whisk until the chocolate is completely melted and the filling is uniform.
5.  **The Set:** Pour the hot filling into the cooled pie crust. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the pudding to prevent a "skin" from forming.
6.  **Chill:** Refrigerate for **at least 4 hours** (uncovered after the first hour) until perfectly set.
7.  **Serve:** Top with billowy whipped cream and shaved chocolate for **Texture Integrity**.
