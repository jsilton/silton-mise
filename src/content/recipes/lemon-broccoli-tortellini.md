## Chef's Note
This is a 25-minute "Speed" hero that avoids the "mushy vegetable" trap of most one-pot pastas. We use **Texture Integrity** through **The Staged Roast Pattern**: we roast the broccoli at high heat (400°F) until slightly charred *before* combining it with the pasta. This provides a smoky "Snap" that contrasts the soft tortellini. The mandatory **Acid Finish** comes from using both the zest and juice of a whole lemon, which brightens the rich, butter-wilted spinach.

## Directions

1.  **Roast:** Preheat oven to 400°F. On a large baking sheet, toss broccoli with olive oil, half the lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper. Roast for 20-25 minutes until crisp and slightly charred at the edges.
2.  **Boil:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook tortellini according to package directions. **Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water** before draining.
3.  **The Wilt:** In the same pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Sauté shallots, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes for 2 minutes. Fold in the spinach and cook until just collapsed (about 2 mins).
4.  **Emulsify:** Add the lemon zest and the reserved pasta water. Stir until a light, glossy sauce forms.
5.  **Combine:** Add the cooked tortellini and roasted broccoli back to the pot. 
6.  **Bind:** Toss gently over low heat for 1 minute until everything is coated.
7.  **Serve:** Sprinkle with Parmesan and serve hot.
