## Chef's Note

This is a modern quick pasta that uses store-bought cheese tortellini (originally from Emilia-Romagna) with roasted vegetables. The key to keeping the broccoli from turning mushy is roasting it separately at high heat (400°F) until slightly charred before tossing with the pasta - this gives it a smoky, crispy texture that contrasts nicely with the soft, pillowy tortellini. Use both lemon zest and juice for maximum brightness - the zest has aromatic oils that the juice doesn't have. Pasta water creates a light sauce when mixed with butter and Parmesan. This is weeknight cooking at its best.

## Directions

1.  **Roast:** Preheat oven to 400°F. On a large baking sheet, toss broccoli with olive oil, half the lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper. Roast for 20-25 minutes until crisp and slightly charred at the edges.
2.  **Boil:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook tortellini according to package directions. **Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water** before draining.
3.  **The Wilt:** In the same pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Sauté shallots, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes for 2 minutes. Fold in the spinach and cook until just collapsed (about 2 mins).
4.  **Emulsify:** Add the lemon zest and the reserved pasta water. Stir until a light, glossy sauce forms.
5.  **Combine:** Add the cooked tortellini and roasted broccoli back to the pot.
6.  **Bind:** Toss gently over low heat for 1 minute until everything is coated.
7.  **Serve:** Sprinkle with Parmesan and serve hot.
