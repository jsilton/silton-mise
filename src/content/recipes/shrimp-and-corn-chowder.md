## Chef's Note

The secret to an elite chowder without heavy flour is **Culinary Technique** through **The Plantain Bind Method**. By grating an unripe green plantain directly into the stock, we introduce a natural starch that thickens the soup into a velvety Texture as it simmers. We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The 2-Minute Shrimp Standard**: we add the marinated shrimp at the very end and cook for exactly 2 minutes; this ensures they are crispy and succulent. The lime juice provides the mandatory **Acid Balance** to cut the creamy corn milk.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** Toss shrimp with garlic, scallions, lime juice, and salt. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
2.  **Corn Milk:** In a food processor, puree half the corn with the milk. Strain through a coarse sieve, pressing to extract all the liquid.
3.  **The Base:** In a large pot, heat the oil. Sauté onion, pepper, and cumin for 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes.
4.  **Simmer:** Add the corn milk, stock, grated plantain, and remaining whole corn kernels. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 20 minutes until thick and aromatic.
5.  **Refine:** For the Kitchen Standard texture, ladle 2 cups of the soup into a blender and pulse until smooth, then return to the pot.
6.  **The Crunch:** Add the shrimp and its marinade. Cook for 2-3 minutes until just opaque.
7.  **Serve:** Stir in cilantro and cayenne. Serve in warmed bowls.
