## Chef's Note

This is a sophisticated "Comfort" dish that avoids the typical mushy vegetable pitfalls. We use **Textural Balance** by **Roasting** the squash at high heat (425°F) before blending; this caramelizes the natural sugars and creates a deeper, nuttier flavor than boiling ever could. The secret is the **Nutmeg Finish**: a tiny pinch provides the "High Note" that bridges the sweetness of the squash with the richness of the Parmesan cream.

## Directions

1.  **Roast:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss squash cubes and garlic with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread on a baking sheet and roast for 25-30 minutes until tender and caramelized.
2.  **The Emulsion:** Let squash cool for 10 minutes. Transfer to a blender. Add heavy cream, broth, Parmesan, and nutmeg. Blend on high until completely smooth and velvety.
3.  **Pasta:** Boil fettuccine in salted water until **al dente**. **Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water**, then drain.
4.  **Combine:** Return pasta to the pot. Pour the butternut sauce over the noodles and toss vigorously.
5.  **Adjust:** If the sauce is too thick, add reserved pasta water one tablespoon at a time until it reaches a glossy, coating consistency.
6.  **Serve:** Garnish with fresh parsley and extra Parmesan.
