## Chef's Note

This is a modern riff on Fettuccine Alfredo, the Roman dish created by Alfredo di Lelio in 1908 for his pregnant wife who couldn't keep food down. The original was simply butter and Parmesan tossed with hot pasta - no cream. American versions added heavy cream in the 1960s, and this butternut squash variation is a 21st-century attempt to lighten it while maintaining richness. Roast the squash until deeply caramelized rather than boiling it - this concentrates the sugars and prevents a watery sauce.

## Directions

1.  **Roast:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss squash cubes and garlic with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread on a baking sheet and roast for 25-30 minutes until tender and caramelized.
2.  **The Emulsion:** Let squash cool for 10 minutes. Transfer to a blender. Add heavy cream, broth, Parmesan, and nutmeg. Blend on high until completely smooth and velvety.
3.  **Pasta:** Boil fettuccine in salted water until **al dente**. **Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water**, then drain.
4.  **Combine:** Return pasta to the pot. Pour the butternut sauce over the noodles and toss vigorously.
5.  **Adjust:** If the sauce is too thick, add reserved pasta water one tablespoon at a time until it reaches a glossy, coating consistency.
6.  **Serve:** Garnish with fresh parsley and extra Parmesan.
