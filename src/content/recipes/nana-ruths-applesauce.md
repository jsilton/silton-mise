## Chef's Note

This traditional applesauce appears on Jewish holiday tables for Rosh Hashanah, Thanksgiving, and Hanukkah. McIntosh apples have thin skin and high water content, allowing them to break down into naturally velvety texture without needing a blender. Simmering apples in their own juices with just a splash of water produces concentrated apple intensity that commercial brands can't match. Lemon provides acidity.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Core and peel the apples. Cut into large chunks.
2.  **The Rinse:** Place apple chunks in a heavy nonstick pot (like a Le Creuset). Fill with water, rinse, and repeat, leaving about 1/4 inch of water at the bottom of the pot.
3.  **Season:** Squeeze the lemon over the apples. Add the honey, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
4.  **Boil:** Bring to a boil over high heat. Immediately cover and reduce heat to **very low**.
5.  **Simmer:** Cook for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally. The apples should be very soft and falling apart.
6.  **The Crush:** Use a potato masher or the side of a heavy spoon to crush the apples against the side of the pot into a chunky, uniform sauce.
7.  **Serve:** Best served warm with a dusting of extra cinnamon.
