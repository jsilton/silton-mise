## Chef's Note

This is a baseline **Updated Classic** recipe traditional for Rosh Hashanah, Thanksgiving, and Hanukkah. The secret to its elite flavor is the **McIntosh Standard**: McIntosh apples have a thin skin and a high water content, allowing them to break down into a naturally velvety Texture without the need for a blender. We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Low-Slow Moisture Method**: we simmer the apples in their own juices with just a splash of water, resulting in a concentrated apple intensity that commercial brands cannot match. The lemon provide the mandatory **Acid Balance**.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Core and peel the apples. Cut into large chunks.
2.  **The Rinse:** Place apple chunks in a heavy nonstick pot (like a Le Creuset). Fill with water, rinse, and repeat, leaving about 1/4 inch of water at the bottom of the pot.
3.  **Season:** Squeeze the lemon over the apples. Add the honey, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
4.  **Boil:** Bring to a boil over high heat. Immediately cover and reduce heat to **very low**.
5.  **Simmer:** Cook for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally. The apples should be very soft and falling apart.
6.  **The Crush:** Use a potato masher or the side of a heavy spoon to crush the apples against the side of the pot into a chunky, uniform sauce.
7.  **Serve:** Best served warm with a dusting of extra cinnamon.
