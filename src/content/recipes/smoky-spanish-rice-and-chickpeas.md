## Chef's Note

This Spanish-inspired rice dish draws from paella technique. Frying dry rice in onion-garlic oil for 3 minutes before adding liquid toasts the starch, creating distinct, individual grains rather than sticky clumps—a technique called socarrat in traditional paella. Smoked paprika (pimentón) introduces wood-fired depth that elevates simple canned chickpeas, adding complexity without additional ingredients.

## Directions

1.  **Foundation:** In a large deep skillet, heat 2 tbsp oil. Sauté onion for 7 minutes until soft. Add garlic, paprika, and oregano; sauté for 2 minutes until the spices bloom.
2.  **The Toast:** Add the dry rice. Stir constantly for 3 minutes until the grains are coated in the red oil and smell nutty.
3.  **The Simmer:** Stir in the tomatoes, chickpeas, and broth. Bring to a boil.
4.  **The Finish:** Reduce heat to **low**. Cover tightly. Simmer for 20-22 minutes until the liquid is absorbed.
5.  **The Steam Cycle:** Remove from heat. **Do not open the lid.** Let sit for 6 minutes (mandatory for structure).
6.  **Finish:** Fluff with a fork. If adding shrimp, nestle them into the rice during the final 5 minutes of simmering. If adding spinach, stir it in during the steam cycle.
