## Chef's Note

This is a **Updated Classic** update to the standard holiday stuffing. The secret to its Success is **Textural Balance** through **The Ciabatta Soak Method**: instead of dry croutons, we use milk-saturated ciabatta. This ensures the stuffing has a custardy Texture rather than a dry crunch. We use **The Sausage Render Method**: we brown the sausage on medium-high to release all its fat, which then acts as the primary seasoning for the kale and aromatics. The massive hit of fresh parsley provides the mandatory **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **The Soak:** Place ciabatta slices in a large bowl. Drizzle with milk and let sit for 30 minutes, flipping once, until fully saturated.
2.  **The Sear:** In a large Dutch oven, cook sausage over medium-high, breaking it up until golden brown (10-15 mins).
3.  **Aromatics:** Add onion, celery, parsley, and garlic to the sausage fat. Sauté for 8 minutes until soft and fragrant.
4.  **The Wilt:** Add kale and 1/2 cup water. Cover and cook for 5 minutes until just wilted.
5.  **The Mix:** In a massive bowl, tear the soaked ciabatta into bite-sized pieces. Add the sausage-kale mixture, Parmesan, and all fresh herbs. Toss gently with your hands until perfectly integrated.
6.  **Bake:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Transfer mixture to a greased 9x13 baking dish. Bake uncovered for 25-30 minutes until the top is deep golden and the center is 150°F.
7.  **Rest:** Let sit for 5 minutes before serving.
