## Chef's Note

This is an Italian-American twist on traditional Thanksgiving stuffing, reflecting how Italian immigrant families adapted American holiday traditions with their own ingredients. Using ciabatta (Italian bread with large air pockets) instead of white bread, Italian sausage instead of sage sausage, and kale with Parmesan gives this stuffing a distinctly Italian character. Soaking the bread in milk creates a custardy texture rather than dry croutons. Brown the sausage well to render its fat, which becomes your cooking medium for the vegetables. The combination of fresh herbs - parsley, basil, sage, rosemary - is classically Italian. Make this a day ahead and refrigerate, then bake before serving.

## Directions

1.  **The Soak:** Place ciabatta slices in a large bowl. Drizzle with milk and let sit for 30 minutes, flipping once, until fully saturated.
2.  **The Sear:** In a large Dutch oven, cook sausage over medium-high, breaking it up until golden brown (10-15 mins).
3.  **Aromatics:** Add onion, celery, parsley, and garlic to the sausage fat. Sauté for 8 minutes until soft and fragrant.
4.  **The Wilt:** Add kale and 1/2 cup water. Cover and cook for 5 minutes until just wilted.
5.  **The Mix:** In a massive bowl, tear the soaked ciabatta into bite-sized pieces. Add the sausage-kale mixture, Parmesan, and all fresh herbs. Toss gently with your hands until perfectly integrated.
6.  **Bake:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Transfer mixture to a greased 9x13 baking dish. Bake uncovered for 25-30 minutes until the top is deep golden and the center is 150°F.
7.  **Rest:** Let sit for 5 minutes before serving.
