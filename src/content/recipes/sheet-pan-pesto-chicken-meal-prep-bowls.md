## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate **Modularity** component for high-performance meal prep. The secret to Success is **The Double-Stage Roast Method**: we roast the chicken and mushrooms first to develop a Maillard "Snap," then add the delicate broccoli and zucchini for the final 10 minutes. This prevents the vegetables from turning into a mushy film. We use **The Pesto Emulsion** as a thermal guard: by tossing the chicken in pesto _before_ roasting, we create a fat barrier that keeps the lean breast meat succulent and "Bouncy."

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a massive sheet pan with parchment.
2.  **The Pesto:** In a small bowl, whisk pesto, Parmesan, garlic, salt, and pepper.
3.  **Stage 1:** Toss the diced chicken and mushrooms with 1 tbsp oil and 2 tbsp of the pesto mixture. Spread on the pan. Bake for 10 minutes.
4.  **Stage 2:** Remove pan. Add the broccoli, zucchini, and cherry tomatoes. Toss with another 2 tbsp of pesto.
5.  **Bake:** Roast for 10 more minutes until the chicken is cooked through (165°F) and the broccoli is tender-crisp.
6.  **Store:** Divide among 4 bowls. Serve over pasta or rice. Keeps in the fridge for 5 days with a perfect Texture when reheated.
