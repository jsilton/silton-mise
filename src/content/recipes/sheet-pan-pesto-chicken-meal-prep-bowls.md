## Chef's Note

Sheet pan meal prep bowls became hugely popular in the 2010s for their simplicity and make-ahead convenience. The trick is staged roasting: cook the chicken and mushrooms first to develop color, then add the quicker-cooking vegetables like broccoli and zucchini for the final 10 minutes. Tossing the chicken in pesto before roasting creates a flavorful coating that keeps the lean breast meat moist. These bowls keep well for 5 days in the fridge.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a massive sheet pan with parchment.
2.  **The Pesto:** In a small bowl, whisk pesto, Parmesan, garlic, salt, and pepper.
3.  **Stage 1:** Toss the diced chicken and mushrooms with 1 tbsp oil and 2 tbsp of the pesto mixture. Spread on the pan. Bake for 10 minutes.
4.  **Stage 2:** Remove pan. Add the broccoli, zucchini, and cherry tomatoes. Toss with another 2 tbsp of pesto.
5.  **Bake:** Roast for 10 more minutes until the chicken is cooked through (165°F) and the broccoli is tender-crisp.
6.  **Store:** Divide among 4 bowls. Serve over pasta or rice. Keeps in the fridge for 5 days with a perfect Texture when reheated.
