## Chef's Note
This soup is a masterclass in **Modern Heritage** flavor development. The secret is the **Low-Slow Moisture Pattern**: we sauté the vegetables in butter for a full 45-60 minutes *before* adding the broth. This ensures they release all their internal moisture and natural sugars, resulting in a depth of flavor that a quick boil can't achieve. We use **The Acid/Sweet Finish**: topping the earthy fennel with a maple-whisked crème fraîche provides the mandatory "High Note" that makes the soup taste like a professional restaurant course.

## Directions

1.  **Sweat:** In a large heavy pot, melt 4 tbsp butter over medium. Add fennel, onion, carrots, and potato. Season with salt and pepper.
2.  **Low & Slow:** Reduce heat to **medium-low**, cover, and cook for 45-60 minutes. Stir occasionally. The vegetables should be very soft and aromatic but not browned.
3.  **Simmer:** Add broth, thyme, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes until the potato is falling apart. Remove herbs.
4.  **The Emulsion:** Working in batches, puree the soup in a blender until perfectly smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve for an even more elite texture.
5.  **Toast:** Heat the remaining 2 tbsp butter in a small pan. Add chopped chestnuts and cook until the butter is nutty brown and the nuts are fragrant.
6.  **The Crown:** Whisk the crème fraîche and maple syrup together.
7.  **Serve:** Ladle soup into bowls. Top with a swirl of maple crème fraîche and the brown-butter chestnuts.
