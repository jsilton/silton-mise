## Chef's Note

Melting chocolate directly into hot coffee "blooms" cocoa solids and releases aromatic compounds that water can't extract. A small amount of corn syrup in the ganache keeps it mirror-shiny and pliable for days. Baking at low temperature (300°F) produces an even, flat-topped rise without doming.

## Directions

1.  **The Bloom:** Preheat oven to 300°F. Grease two 10-inch pans and line with parchment. Whisk the 3 oz chopped chocolate into the hot coffee until smooth. Let cool.
2.  **Dry Mix:** Sift together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
3.  **Aeration:** In a stand mixer, beat eggs until pale and thickened (3-5 mins). Slowly stream in oil, buttermilk, vanilla, and the cooled coffee-chocolate mixture.
4.  **Combine:** Add the dry mix and beat on medium speed until **just combined**. The batter will be very thin.
5.  **Bake:** Divide between pans. Bake for 60-70 minutes until a tester comes out clean. Cool completely in the pans before inverting.
6.  **The Ganache:** Bring cream, sugar, and corn syrup to a boil. Pour over the 1 lb chopped chocolate. Let sit for 5 minutes, then whisk. Add butter cubes and stir until mirror-glossy.
7.  **Assemble:** Frost between layers and over the top and sides. Let set for 1 hour at room temperature before serving.
