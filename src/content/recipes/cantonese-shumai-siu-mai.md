## Chef's Note

Shumai is the test of a Dim Sum master. The secret to the "Restaurant Bounce" is **Culinary Technique**: you must stir the pork and shrimp mixture vigorously in one direction for 5 minutes until it becomes a sticky, emulsified paste. This creates the snap that differentiates a real shumai from a simple meatball. Always use dried shiitakes for their intense, concentrated umami.

## Directions

1.  **The Paste:** In a large bowl, combine pork, chopped shrimp, cornstarch, wine, and seasonings. Stir **vigorously in one direction** until the meat is pale and very sticky.
2.  **Add Texture:** Fold in the mushrooms and water chestnuts.
3.  **Shape:** Place a wrapper in your palm. Scoop 1.5 tbsp of filling. Squeeze the wrapper around the meat to form a "cup" with the meat exposed at the top. Flatten the base so it stands up.
4.  **Garnish:** Press a tiny amount of diced carrot into the center of each top.
5.  **Steam:** Place in a bamboo steamer lined with parchment. Steam over boiling water for 8-10 minutes until the internal temp is 165°F.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with hot chili oil.
