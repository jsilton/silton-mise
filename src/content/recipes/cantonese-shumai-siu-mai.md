## Chef's Note

Shumai (also spelled siu mai) are open-topped Cantonese dumplings, a dim sum staple from Guangdong province. The distinctive bouncy texture comes from stirring the pork and shrimp mixture vigorously in one direction for several minutes until it becomes sticky—this develops the protein and gives it that characteristic snap. Dried shiitake mushrooms are essential for their concentrated umami flavor. The yellow egg wrappers and the small diced carrot or goji berry garnish on top are traditional touches.

## Directions

1.  **The Paste:** In a large bowl, combine pork, chopped shrimp, cornstarch, wine, and seasonings. Stir **vigorously in one direction** until the meat is pale and very sticky.
2.  **Add Texture:** Fold in the mushrooms and water chestnuts.
3.  **Shape:** Place a wrapper in your palm. Scoop 1.5 tbsp of filling. Squeeze the wrapper around the meat to form a "cup" with the meat exposed at the top. Flatten the base so it stands up.
4.  **Garnish:** Press a tiny amount of diced carrot into the center of each top.
5.  **Steam:** Place in a bamboo steamer lined with parchment. Steam over boiling water for 8-10 minutes until the internal temp is 165°F.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with hot chili oil.
