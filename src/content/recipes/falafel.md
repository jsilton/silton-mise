## Chef's Note

The single most important rule of falafel: **NEVER USE CANNED CHICKPEAS.** Canned chickpeas are already cooked and mushy; they will fall apart in the oil. Dried chickpeas, soaked overnight, provide the raw starch needed to bind the ball together without flour. We use a massive amount of fresh herbs to create a vibrant green interior and **Baking Powder** to ensure the falafel is airy and light rather than a dense puck.

## Directions

1.  **The Soak:** Place dried chickpeas in a large bowl. Cover with at least 3 inches of water. Let soak for 12-24 hours. They will triple in size.
2.  **The Grind:** Drain the chickpeas and pat them dry. In a food processor, pulse the chickpeas, parsley, cilantro, onion, and garlic until the mixture looks like coarse sand. **Do not puree it into a paste.**
3.  **The Spices:** Crush the cumin and coriander seeds in a mortar and pestle. Stir them into the chickpea mixture along with the salt, pepper, and baking powder.
4.  **The Rest:** Refrigerate the mixture for 30 minutes. This allows the starch to set so the balls don't break.
5.  **Shape:** Form into walnut-sized balls or flat discs.
6.  **Fry:** Heat 2 inches of oil in a pot to 350°F. Fry in batches for 3-4 minutes until the outside is deep brown and the inside is steamed and green.
7.  **Drain:** Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. Serve immediately.
