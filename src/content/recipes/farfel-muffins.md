## Chef's Note

This is an update to a beloved Passover tradition. Replacing the traditional margarine with unsalted butter provides richer flavor and a more consistent golden crust. The secret to success is the cooling pause: after mixing the farfel (toasted egg barley) with boiling water, you must let it cool completely before adding the eggs. This prevents the eggs from scrambling and ensures a firm, bready texture that makes these ideal for Passover breakfasts.

## Directions

1.  **Hydrate:** Preheat oven to 400°F. In a large bowl, pour the boiling water over the matzo farfel. Stir once and let sit until the water is fully absorbed and the mixture is cool to the touch.
2.  **The Emulsion:** Stir in the melted butter. Add the eggs **one at a time**, stirring vigorously after each addition until the batter is glossy and uniform. Season with salt.
3.  **Fill:** Spoon the batter into a well-greased muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.
4.  **Bake:** Bake at 400°F for 20 minutes until the tops are deep golden brown and the muffins feel light when lifted.
5.  **Serve:** Best served warm with plenty of salted butter.
