## Chef's Note

Never let mulled cider reach a rolling boil once spices are added—high heat turns cinnamon bitter. A tiny pinch of sea salt amplifies the natural sweetness of apples. Studding fresh orange wedges with cloves releases essential oils directly into the mug when served, adding aromatic complexity.

## Directions

1.  **Combine:** In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the apple cider, brown sugar, allspice, 1 tsp cloves, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon sticks.
2.  **Heat:** Bring the mixture just to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.
3.  **Infuse:** Immediately reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. **Do not let it reach a rolling boil.**
4.  **Strain:** Pour the cider through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean pot or slow cooker to remove the whole spices.
5.  **Garnish:** Stud each orange wedge with a whole clove.
6.  **Serve:** Ladle into mugs and float a clove-studded orange wedge in each.
