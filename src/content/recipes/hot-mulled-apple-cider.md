## Chef's Note

This is the baseline for winter **Modularity**. The secret to a professional-grade mulch is **The Low-Simmer Infusion Method**: you must never boil the cider once the spices are added, as high heat can turn the cinnamon bitter. We use a tiny pinch of **Sea Salt** as the complex flavor to amplify the natural sweetness of the apples. The mandatory **Acid/Aromatic Finish** comes from studding fresh orange wedges with cloves—this releases essential oils directly into the mug as you serve.

## Directions

1.  **Combine:** In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the apple cider, brown sugar, allspice, 1 tsp cloves, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon sticks.
2.  **Heat:** Bring the mixture just to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.
3.  **Infuse:** Immediately reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. **Do not let it reach a rolling boil.**
4.  **Strain:** Pour the cider through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean pot or slow cooker to remove the whole spices.
5.  **Garnish:** Stud each orange wedge with a whole clove.
6.  **Serve:** Ladle into mugs and float a clove-studded orange wedge in each.
