## Chef's Note

This is the **Kitchen Standard** of takeout classics. The secret to restaurant-quality chicken is the **Culinary Technique** of **Velveting**. By marinating the chicken in Shaoxing wine and cornstarch, we create a protective barrier that keeps the meat succulent and prevents it from toughening over high heat. We also use **the texture Method**: we steam the broccoli with just a splash of water first, then sear the chicken, ensuring the vegetable maintains its Crunch while the meat gets a slight char.

## Directions

1.  **Velveting:** Slice chicken thin against the grain. Toss with wine, cornstarch, and salt. Let sit for 10-15 minutes (mandatory for texture).
2.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together oyster sauce, wine, dark soy, stock, sugar, and cornstarch.
3.  **Steam:** Heat a large wok or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1/3 cup water and the broccoli. Cover and steam for 45-60 seconds until bright green. Remove broccoli and wipe the pan dry.
4.  **Sear:** Add oil to the pan. Spread chicken in a single layer. Let sit undisturbed for 1 minute to develop a brown crust. Flip and stir-fry until almost cooked through.
5.  **Aromatics:** Push chicken to the side. Add garlic and ginger. Sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant.
6.  **The Glaze:** Return broccoli to the pan. Whisk the sauce again (cornstarch settles!) and pour it in.
7.  **Finish:** Toss vigorously for 1 minute until the sauce thickens into a glossy glaze. Serve immediately.
