## Chef's Note

Chicken and broccoli became a Chinese-American takeout staple in the mid-20th century. The secret to tender chicken is "velveting"—marinating sliced chicken in Shaoxing wine and cornstarch creates a protective coating that keeps the meat succulent over high heat. Steam the broccoli briefly with water first, then sear the chicken separately so each element has the right texture. The oyster sauce-based glaze should be glossy and coat everything evenly.

## Directions

1.  **Velveting:** Slice chicken thin against the grain. Toss with wine, cornstarch, and salt. Let sit for 10-15 minutes (mandatory for texture).
2.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together oyster sauce, wine, dark soy, stock, sugar, and cornstarch.
3.  **Steam:** Heat a large wok or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1/3 cup water and the broccoli. Cover and steam for 45-60 seconds until bright green. Remove broccoli and wipe the pan dry.
4.  **Sear:** Add oil to the pan. Spread chicken in a single layer. Let sit undisturbed for 1 minute to develop a brown crust. Flip and stir-fry until almost cooked through.
5.  **Aromatics:** Push chicken to the side. Add garlic and ginger. Sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant.
6.  **The Glaze:** Return broccoli to the pan. Whisk the sauce again (cornstarch settles!) and pour it in.
7.  **Finish:** Toss vigorously for 1 minute until the sauce thickens into a glossy glaze. Serve immediately.
