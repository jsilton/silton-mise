## Chef's Note

The tangzhong method - pre-cooking flour and water into a paste - is an Asian bread technique that keeps these rolls soft for days. It pre-gelatinizes starches so the dough holds more moisture without becoming sticky. European-style butter's higher fat content (82% versus 80% in American butter) creates an especially tender crumb.

## Directions

1.  **The Tangzhong:** In a small saucepan, whisk 1/4 cup flour and 3/4 cup water. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly until it forms a thick paste. Let cool.
2.  **The Mix:** In a stand mixer, combine flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Add the cream, milk, egg, vanilla, and the cooled Tangzhong. Knead with a dough hook for 2 minutes.
3.  **The Butter:** On low speed, add the 8 tbsp butter one tablespoon at a time. Once incorporated, knead for 10-12 minutes until the dough is smooth, elastic, and passes the windowpane test.
4.  **First Rise:** Shape into a ball, place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rest in a warm spot for 30 minutes.
5.  **Shape:** On a floured surface, roll dough into a 15x21-inch rectangle. Spread the cinnamon filling to the edges, leaving a 1-inch border at the top.
6.  **The Cut:** Use a pizza cutter to slice twelve 1.75-inch strips. Roll each strip tightly and place in a parchment-lined 9x13 pan.
7.  **Second Rise:** Cover and let rise until doubled (1-2 hours). Preheat oven to 325°F.
8.  **Bake:** Bake for 30-35 minutes until the tops are just starting to turn golden brown.
9.  **The Frosting:** Whip the cream cheese and butter until smooth. Mix in powdered sugar, vanilla, and cream until fluffy.
10. **Finish:** Let the rolls cool for 15 minutes, then spread the frosting generously while they are still warm to allow some of it to seep into the spirals.
