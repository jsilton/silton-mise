## Chef's Note

This quick stir-fry showcases the Cantonese approach to spring vegetables, pairing sweet, crisp snow peas with tender shrimp. Soaking rice noodles in hot (not boiling) water prevents them from breaking apart, while marinating shrimp in sweet chili sauce creates caramelized edges when seared in a hot wok.

## Directions

1.  **Noodles:** Place rice noodles in a bowl of hot (not boiling) water. Let soak for 25 minutes until flexible. Drain and rinse in cold water.
2.  **Velvet:** Toss shrimp with 1 tbsp sweet chili sauce and salt. **Let stand for 15 minutes**.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok until smoking. Sear shrimp for 1 minute per side until charred and pink. Remove.
4.  **The Crunch:** Add 1 tbsp oil. Sauté snow peas, ginger, and garlic for 2 minutes over high heat until bright green.
5.  **Bind:** Add the drained noodles and the remaining sweet chili sauce. Toss vigorously for 4 minutes until the noodles are hot and glossy.
6.  **Serve:** Return shrimp to the pan. Toss for 30 seconds. Serve immediately.
