## Chef's Note
This is the baseline for 20-minute "Speed" main dishes. The secret to Success is **The Cold Soak Pattern**: you must soak the rice noodles in hot water for 25 minutes rather than boiling them; this ensures they maintain a resilient "Bounce" and don't turn into a tangled mush. We use **The Sugared Sear Pattern**: marinating the shrimp in sweet chili sauce for 15 minutes allows the sugars to caramelize instantly when they hit the hot wok, providing a professional-grade mahogany "Snap."

## Directions

1.  **Noodles:** Place rice noodles in a bowl of hot (not boiling) water. Let soak for 25 minutes until flexible. Drain and rinse in cold water.
2.  **Velvet:** Toss shrimp with 1 tbsp sweet chili sauce and salt. **Let stand for 15 minutes**.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok until smoking. Sear shrimp for 1 minute per side until charred and pink. Remove.
4.  **The Snap:** Add 1 tbsp oil. Sauté snow peas, ginger, and garlic for 2 minutes over high heat until bright green.
5.  **Bind:** Add the drained noodles and the remaining sweet chili sauce. Toss vigorously for 4 minutes until the noodles are hot and glossy.
6.  **Serve:** Return shrimp to the pan. Toss for 30 seconds. Serve immediately.
