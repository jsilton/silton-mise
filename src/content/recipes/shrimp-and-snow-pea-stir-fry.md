## Directions

1. Bring 3-4 quarts of water to a boil and remove from heat. Place rice linguine noodles in a large metal or glass bowl and cover in hot water for 25 minutes, stirring with a fork frequently to break up any noodle clumps. After about 15 minutes water should be cool enough to pull out and separate any clumped noodles.
2. Rinse shrimp and place on a paper towel lined plate. Pat dry and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Add shrimp and 1 tablespoon sweet chili sauce to a container with a lid. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes and up to overnight.
3. Drain and rinse noodles and return to the bowl. Gather your ingredients (noodles, shrimp, remaining 1/4 cup sweet chili sauce, and snow peas) in bowls and place on a sheet tray next to the stove.
4. Heat a large skillet or wok over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil and swirl in pan to coat. When you see the first wisp of smoke, add shrimp and cook until they begin to turn pink, 1 minute each side. The sugars in the sweet chili sauce should caramelize just a little bit and create tasty bits in the pan.
5. Make space in the middle of the pan, add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and sliced snow peas and cook 2 minutes. Add prepared noodles and ¼ cup of sweet chili sauce. Continue to cook until noodles are coated and heated through, about 4 to 6 minutes. Serve immediately.
