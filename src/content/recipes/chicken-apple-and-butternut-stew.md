## Chef's Note

This is a New England autumn stew. To avoid the mushy veggie problem, sear the chicken and parsnips first to get a crust, and only add the apples in the final 5 minutes of simmering. The apple cider provides natural acid and sweetness that elevates this from a standard chicken stew to a sophisticated meal.

## Directions

1.  **Sear:** Heat oil in a Dutch oven. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Brown the chicken in batches and remove to a plate.
2.  **Sauté:** Add the onion, sage, and ginger to the pot. Cook for 2 minutes. Add the parsnips and cook for another 5 minutes until browned.
3.  **Thicken:** Sprinkle flour over the veg and stir for 1 minute (to cook out the raw flour taste).
4.  **Simmer:** Gradually whisk in the apple cider and stock. Return the chicken to the pot. Add the butternut squash.
5.  **Cook:** Simmer over low heat, partially covered, for 25 minutes until the squash is tender.
6.  **The Apple Finish:** Stir in the diced apples. Cook for only 5 more minutes—you want the apples to be warm but still hold their shape and tartness.
