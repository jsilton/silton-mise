## Chef's Note

The secret to a meringue that is "Chewy" rather than just "Crispy" is the **Sugar Dissolution**. By gently heating the egg whites and sugar before whipping, you ensure the sugar crystals are fully dissolved into the protein structure. This results in a silky, stable foam that bakes into a cookie with a "shattering" shell and a marshmallow-like fudgy center.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 250°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
2.  **Dissolve:** In a heat-proof bowl set over a pot of simmering water (double boiler), combine egg whites, sugar, and salt. Whisk gently until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture feels smooth (not gritty) between your fingers.
3.  **Whip:** Transfer to a stand mixer. Add cream of tartar. Whip on high speed for 8-10 minutes until the whites are stiff, glossy, and the bowl feels cool to the touch.
4.  **Fold:** Gently fold in the chocolate chips by hand.
5.  **Portion:** Use a large spoon or cookie scoop to place clouds of batter onto the sheets. They will not spread, so you can place them 1 inch apart.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 45-50 minutes. The cookies are done when the outside is firm but the center still feels slightly soft.
7.  **Cool:** Let cool completely on the baking sheet to allow the shell to set.
