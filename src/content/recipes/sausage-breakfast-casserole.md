## Chef's Note

This breakfast casserole is ideal for holiday mornings because it feeds a crowd and can be assembled the night before. Baking covered first sets the egg custard without drying it out, then uncovering and increasing heat to 400°F for the final 15 minutes crisps the hash brown crust on top. Whisking Dijon mustard into the cream cuts through the heavy sausage fat, adding tangy brightness that prevents the dish from feeling overly rich.

## Directions

1.  **The Sear:** In a large skillet, brown the sausage over medium-high until no pink remains. Add the bell pepper and scallion whites; sauté for 3 minutes. Let cool slightly.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a massive bowl, whisk eggs, heavy cream, mustard, hot sauce, salt, and pepper until very frothy.
3.  **Combine:** Fold in the sausage mixture, 1 1/2 cups of the cheese, and the thawed hash browns.
4.  **Assemble:** Pour into a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Smooth into an even layer.
5.  **Stage 1:** Cover with foil. Bake at 350°F for 50 minutes.
6.  **Stage 2:** Remove foil. Top with the remaining 1/2 cup cheese. **Increase oven to 400°F**. Bake for 10-15 minutes until the top is deep golden and the center is firm.
7.  **Serve:** Let rest for 10 minutes. Garnish with scallion greens and serve.
