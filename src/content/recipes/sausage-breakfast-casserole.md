## Chef's Note

This is the definitive Executive nutritious for holiday mornings. The secret to its Success is **The Double-Bake Method**: we bake the casserole covered to set the internal custard, then uncover and increase the heat to 400°F for the final 15 minutes. This ensures a moist Texture in the center with a shatteringly crisp Crunch on the hash brown crust. We use **The Mustard Pulse**: whisking Dijon into the cream cuts through the heavy sausage fat, providing a mandatory **Acid Balance** that keeps the dish light.

## Directions

1.  **The Sear:** In a large skillet, brown the sausage over medium-high until no pink remains. Add the bell pepper and scallion whites; sauté for 3 minutes. Let cool slightly.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a massive bowl, whisk eggs, heavy cream, mustard, hot sauce, salt, and pepper until very frothy.
3.  **Combine:** Fold in the sausage mixture, 1 1/2 cups of the cheese, and the thawed hash browns.
4.  **Assemble:** Pour into a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Smooth into an even layer.
5.  **Stage 1:** Cover with foil. Bake at 350°F for 50 minutes.
6.  **Stage 2:** Remove foil. Top with the remaining 1/2 cup cheese. **Increase oven to 400°F**. Bake for 10-15 minutes until the top is deep golden and the center is firm.
7.  **Serve:** Let rest for 10 minutes. Garnish with scallion greens and serve.
