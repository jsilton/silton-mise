## Chef's Note

This is the definitive Silton **Modern Heritage** recipe for a Jewish comfort classic. The secret to its elite texture is **The Triple Cream Pattern**: by utilizing sour cream, cottage cheese, and cream cheese together, we create a multi-dimensional "Bounce" that is rich but has structural integrity. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The Corn Flake Snap**: we top the pudding with a mixture of crushed corn flakes and brown sugar, which creates a shatteringly crisp crust that contrasts the custardy interior.

## Directions

1.  **The Pasta:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles for 10 minutes until **al dente**. Drain well.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a massive bowl, whisk together the sour cream, softened cream cheese, and cottage cheese. Add the beaten eggs, sugar, cinnamon, and half of the melted butter. Whisk until perfectly smooth.
3.  **Combine:** Fold the warm noodles and the golden raisins into the cream mixture. Stir until every noodle is saturated.
4.  **Assemble:** Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with melted butter. Pour the noodle mixture into the dish.
5.  **The Snap:** In a small bowl, toss the crushed corn flakes with brown sugar and the remaining melted butter. Spread evenly over the top of the pudding.
6.  **Bake:** Bake at 350°F for 1 hour until the center is set and the top is a deep, crunchy golden brown.
7.  **Serve:** Let rest for 15 minutes before slicing. This allows the custard to set into a firm "Bounce."
