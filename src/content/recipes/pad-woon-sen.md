## Chef's Note

This is the lighter, high-fiber cousin of Pad Thai. The secret to working with **Glass Noodles** is **The Hot-Soak Pattern**: you must soak them in hot (not boiling) water for exactly 10 minutes; this allows them to reach their maximum "Bounce" while remaining completely translucent. We use **The Veggie Char Pattern**: we sauté the cabbage and peppers on high heat until they develop blackened edges before adding the noodles—this ensures **Texture Integrity** and provides a smoky "Snap."

## Directions

1.  **Noodles:** Soak mung bean noodles in hot water for 10 minutes. Drain and rinse in cold water.
2.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together oyster sauce, fish sauce, soy sauce, and sugar.
3.  **The Egg:** In a wok, heat a splash of oil. Scramble the eggs with a pinch of salt until just set. Remove and roughly chop.
4.  **The Snap:** Heat oil until smoking. Sauté cabbage and peppers for 3-4 minutes until charred at the edges but still firm. Transfer to the egg plate.
5.  **Aromatics:** Add fresh oil. Sauté onions, carrots, and garlic for 3 minutes until soft.
6.  **Bind:** Add the drained noodles and the sauce. Toss vigorously over medium-high for 3 minutes until the noodles are glossy and have absorbed the liquid.
7.  **Finish:** Return the eggs and charred veg to the wok. Stir in the Thai chile and scallions for the mandatory **High Note**.
8.  **Serve:** Serve hot or at room temperature for the Gold Standard fuel profile.
