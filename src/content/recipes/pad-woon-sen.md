## Chef's Note

Pad woon sen is a Thai glass noodle stir-fry that's lighter than pad thai. Mung bean glass noodles should be soaked in hot (not boiling) water for exactly 10 minutes to reach their optimal translucent texture. Sautéing cabbage and peppers over high heat until they develop charred edges before adding noodles creates smoky depth.

## Directions

1.  **Noodles:** Soak mung bean noodles in hot water for 10 minutes. Drain and rinse in cold water.
2.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together oyster sauce, fish sauce, soy sauce, and sugar.
3.  **The Egg:** In a wok, heat a splash of oil. Scramble the eggs with a pinch of salt until just set. Remove and roughly chop.
4.  **The Crunch:** Heat oil until smoking. Sauté cabbage and peppers for 3-4 minutes until charred at the edges but still firm. Transfer to the egg plate.
5.  **Aromatics:** Add fresh oil. Sauté onions, carrots, and garlic for 3 minutes until soft.
6.  **Bind:** Add the drained noodles and the sauce. Toss vigorously over medium-high for 3 minutes until the noodles are glossy and have absorbed the liquid.
7.  **Finish:** Return the eggs and charred veg to the wok. Stir in the Thai chile and scallions for the mandatory **High Note**.
8.  **Serve:** Serve hot or at room temperature for the Kitchen Standard fuel profile.
