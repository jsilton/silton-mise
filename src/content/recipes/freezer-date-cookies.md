## Chef's Note

These are nutritious cookies designed for long-term freezer storage. The key to their texture is processing the Medjool dates directly with the melted butter in a food processor to create a smooth, caramel-like paste that acts as the primary sweetener. We use buckwheat flour to provide a nutty, earthy depth that contrasts with the sweetness of the dates. These are explicitly designed to be kept in the freezer and eaten cold for a crispy energy boost.

## Directions

1.  **The Date Paste:** Place the pitted Medjool dates and melted butter in a food processor. Pulse on high until a completely smooth, thick paste forms.
2.  **The Emulsion:** Add the egg, yogurt, and vanilla to the processor. Pulse for 10 seconds until perfectly integrated.
3.  **Dry Mix:** In a separate bowl, whisk together buckwheat flour, whole wheat flour, oats, baking soda, and cinnamon.
4.  **Combine:** Pour the date mixture into the dry ingredients. Mix with a spatula until a thick, sticky dough forms.
5.  **Shape:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Roll the dough into small balls (about 1 tbsp each). Place on a greased cookie sheet and **press down firmly** with your palm to create a 1/2-inch thick disk.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 12-15 minutes until the edges are lightly browned.
7.  **The Freeze:** Let cool completely. Transfer to a freezer bag. These are at their Kitchen Standard when eaten straight from the freezer.
