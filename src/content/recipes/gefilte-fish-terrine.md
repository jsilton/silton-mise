## Chef's Note

This baked salmon-carp terrine modernizes traditional Passover gefilte fish. Pulse fish in food processor just until coarsely ground, not paste - this ensures meaty texture. Baking in a water bath (bain-marie) helps cream and eggs set into silky, souffle-like structure. Serve chilled with fresh horseradish salad for brightness.

## Directions

1.  **Sweat:** Heat oil in a skillet. Sauté the onion for 8-10 minutes until soft and translucent (do not brown).
2.  **The Grind:** Pulse the carp and salmon in a food processor until coarsely ground. Transfer to a large bowl with the onions.
3.  **Bind:** Stir in the cream, matzo meal, dill, salt, pepper, eggs, shredded carrot, and lemon zest. Whisk in 3/4 cup cold water until smooth.
4.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 325°F. Line a 9x5 loaf pan with plastic wrap (extending over the edges). Spread the fish mixture into the pan. Seal with the overhanging plastic and cover with foil.
5.  **Bain-Marie:** Place the loaf pan inside a 9x13 baking dish. Fill the larger dish with boiling water until it reaches halfway up the loaf pan.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 1 hour 15 minutes until the center is firm (160°F).
7.  **Set:** Remove from the water bath and cool. **Chill for at least 4 hours** (ideally overnight) before inverting onto a platter.
8.  **Finish:** Toss arugula, radishes, and horseradish with lemon juice. Serve the chilled slices topped with the fresh salad for the mandatory **Acid Balance**.
