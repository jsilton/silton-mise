## Directions

1. Heat oven to 325°. Line a 9"x 5" loaf pan with plastic wrap, letting at least 4" hang over the edges. Heat 1 tbsp. oil in an 8" skillet over medium; cook onion until soft, 8–10 minutes, and transfer to a bowl. Combine carp and salmon in a food processor; pulse until coarsely ground and transfer to bowl with onion. Add cream, matzo meal, minced dill, salt, pepper, eggs, carrot, lemon zest plus 1 tsp. juice, and 3/4 cup cold water; stir to combine and spread into prepared pan. Wrap plastic wrap over top and cover with parchment paper. Place loaf pan in a 9"x 13" baking dish; pour boiling water into pan to come halfway up outside of loaf pan. Bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 160° or a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Transfer loaf pan to a wire rack; let cool. Remove paper and invert terrine onto a platter; discard plastic wrap. Chill terrine until cold and then cut into slices. Toss remaining olive oil and lemon juice, the dill sprigs, arugula, radishes, horseradish, shallot, salt, and pepper in a bowl; sprinkle over terrine. Serve with lemon wedges and matzos.
