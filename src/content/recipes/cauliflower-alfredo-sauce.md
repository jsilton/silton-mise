## Chef's Note

This is a modern healthy alternative to traditional [Real Alfredo Sauce](/mise/recipes/real-alfredo-sauce), popularized in the 2010s by food bloggers looking for lighter versions of classic Italian-American dishes. The genius is using pureed cauliflower's natural starch to create creaminess with a fraction of the fat. Boil the cauliflower until it's completely soft and falling apart, then blend it while still hot with garlic and Parmesan - the heat helps everything emulsify into a silky sauce. Use a high-powered blender for the smoothest texture.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** In a pot, combine cauliflower and milk/broth. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 12-15 minutes until very soft.
2.  **Infuse:** In a small pan, sauté the garlic in butter for 1 minute until fragrant.
3.  **Blend:** Transfer the hot cauliflower and its cooking liquid to a blender. Add the garlic butter, Parmesan, salt, and nutmeg.
4.  **Emulsify:** Blend on high for 1 minute until completely smooth and velvety.
5.  **Serve:** Toss immediately with your favorite pasta or use as a base for roasted veg.
