## Chef's Note

This is the "Culinary Method" alternative to the heavy [Real Alfredo Sauce](/silton-mise/recipes/real-alfredo-sauce). We use the natural starch of pureed cauliflower to create a creamy texture with a fraction of the fat. The secret is the **High-Powered Blend**: you must boil the cauliflower until it is "fall-apart" tender, then blend it while hot with the garlic and cheese to create a silky emulsion.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** In a pot, combine cauliflower and milk/broth. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 12-15 minutes until very soft.
2.  **Infuse:** In a small pan, sauté the garlic in butter for 1 minute until fragrant.
3.  **Blend:** Transfer the hot cauliflower and its cooking liquid to a blender. Add the garlic butter, Parmesan, salt, and nutmeg.
4.  **Emulsify:** Blend on high for 1 minute until completely smooth and velvety.
5.  **Serve:** Toss immediately with your favorite pasta or use as a base for roasted veg.
