## Chef's Note

This French-inspired crustless quiche prevents wateriness by draining spinach thoroughly after wilting it in sausage fat. Press the mixture firmly in a sieve to remove all excess liquid. A pinch of nutmeg enhances savory custard without making it sweet - a classic French technique.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray a 9-inch pie dish generously with oil spray.
2.  **The Sear:** In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the sausage meat, breaking it into small crumbles, until browned (5 mins).
3.  **The Wilt:** Add the spinach to the skillet. Reduce heat to medium and toss until just wilted. **Drain the mixture in a sieve**, pressing firmly to remove all excess liquid.
4.  **The Custard:** In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, half & half, salt, pepper, and nutmeg until frothy and well aerated.
5.  **Assemble:** Spread the dry sausage/spinach mixture in the bottom of the pie dish. Top with the Cheddar and Parmesan.
6.  **Pour:** Pour the egg mixture over the fillings.
7.  **Bake:** Bake for 35-40 minutes until the center is set and the edges are slightly golden and puffed.
8.  **Rest:** Let sit for 5 minutes before slicing into 6 wedges.
