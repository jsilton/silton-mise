## Chef's Note

This is the scientifically superior method for roast turkey. **The Brine** uses osmosis to drive moisture and seasoning deep into the breast meat, while the **High-Heat Blast** (500°F) at the start triggers massive Maillard browning for crispy skin. We skip the traditional "stuffing" inside the bird (which slows down cooking and dries out the meat) and instead use aromatics to steam the interior with flavor.

## Directions

1.  **The Brine (2-3 days before):** Combine stock, salt, sugar, peppercorns, allspice, and ginger in a pot. Bring to a boil to dissolve solids. Cool to room temp and refrigerate.
2.  **The Soak:** 16 hours before roasting, combine the chilled brine with the ice water in a large bucket. Submerge the turkey breast-side down. Refrigerate for 8-16 hours.
3.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 500°F. Remove bird from brine, rinse with cold water, and **pat bone-dry** (moisture kills the crisp).
4.  **Aromatics:** Microwave the apple, onion, cinnamon, and 1 cup water for 5 minutes. Stuff these into the cavity along with the herbs. Tuck the wings under the bird.
5.  **Coat:** Rub the entire skin liberally with canola oil.
6.  **The Blast:** Roast on the lowest rack at 500°F for 30 minutes.
7.  **The Finish:** Insert a probe thermometer into the thickest part of the breast. Reduce oven to 350°F. Roast until the internal temp hits 161°F (about 2-2.5 hours total).
8.  **Rest:** Let rest for at least 15 minutes before carving. Carryover heat will take it to the safe 165°F.
