## Chef's Note

Shaving Brussels sprouts paper-thin transforms them from dense and bitter to light and crisp—a technique that became popular in modern Italian-American restaurants during the 2000s. Tossing the shaved sprouts with vinegar dressing 15 minutes before serving softens them slightly while maintaining their crunch. Pecorino Romano adds the sharp, salty note that balances the sweet apple and tangy dressing.

## Directions

1.  **The Dressing:** In a large bowl, whisk together vinegar, honey, oil, salt, and pepper until thick and emulsified.
2.  **The Crunch:** Core the apple and cut into fine matchsticks. Immediately toss with 1 tbsp of the dressing to prevent browning.
3.  **Shave:** Use a mandoline or a very sharp chef's knife to shave the Brussels sprouts as thinly as possible. Discard the tough woody stems.
4.  **Bind:** Add the shaved sprouts to the dressing. Toss vigorously with your hands until every strand is coated. Let stand at room temperature for **at least 15 minutes**.
5.  **Finish:** Add the apples and the Pecorino. Toss gently to combine.
6.  **Serve:** Season with an extra crack of black pepper and serve chilled.
