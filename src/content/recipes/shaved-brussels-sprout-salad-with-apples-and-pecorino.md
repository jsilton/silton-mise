## Chef's Note

The secret to a "Gold Standard" sprout salad is **Texture Integrity** through **The Mandoline Pattern**. You must shave the raw sprouts at 1/16th of an inch; this transforms a dense, bitter vegetable into a light, airy pile with a resilient "Bounce." We use **The 15-Minute Set Pattern**: tossing the sprouts in the cider-honey emulsion and letting them rest for 15 minutes allows the acid to soften the fibers, resulting in a sophisticated mouthfeel. The Pecorino provides the mandatory salty **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **The Dressing:** In a large bowl, whisk together vinegar, honey, oil, salt, and pepper until thick and emulsified.
2.  **The Snap:** Core the apple and cut into fine matchsticks. Immediately toss with 1 tbsp of the dressing to prevent browning.
3.  **Shave:** Use a mandoline or a very sharp chef's knife to shave the Brussels sprouts as thinly as possible. Discard the tough woody stems.
4.  **Bind:** Add the shaved sprouts to the dressing. Toss vigorously with your hands until every strand is coated. Let stand at room temperature for **at least 15 minutes**.
5.  **Finish:** Add the apples and the Pecorino. Toss gently to combine.
6.  **Serve:** Season with an extra crack of black pepper and serve chilled.
