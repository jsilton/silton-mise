## Chef's Note

This modern update to my Grandpa's recipe achieves silky texture by sautéing leeks in butter and oil until completely soft and translucent before adding flour and broth—this fully develops their natural sugars. White pepper and nutmeg bridge the gap between earthy potatoes and rich cream, classic French seasonings for potato-leek soup.

## Directions

1.  **The Sweat:** Set Instant Pot to "Sauté." Add butter and olive oil. Once hot, add leeks and sauté for 5-7 minutes until soft. Do not brown.
2.  **Aromatics:** Add garlic and sauté for 30 seconds. Sprinkle the flour over the leeks and stir for 1 minute to cook out the raw starch taste.
3.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the broth slowly, scraping the bottom of the pot to ensure no flour sticks.
4.  **Pressure:** Add potatoes, bay leaf, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Secure the lid. Set to **High Pressure for 7 minutes**.
5.  **Release:** Let the pressure release naturally for 15 minutes (mandatory for potato texture), then vent any remaining steam.
6.  **The Emulsion:** Remove the bay leaf. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup directly in the pot until perfectly smooth.
7.  **Finish:** Stir in the half-and-half. Taste and adjust salt if needed.
8.  **Serve:** Garnish with a dollop of sour cream and fresh chives for **Textural Balance**.
