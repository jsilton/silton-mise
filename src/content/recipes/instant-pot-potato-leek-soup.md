## Chef's Note

This is a **Updated Classic** update to a recipe from my Grandpa. The secret to its elite silkiness is **Culinary Technique** through **The Allium Sweat Method**: you must sauté the leeks in butter and oil until they are completely soft and translucent _before_ adding the flour and broth. This ensures the leeks' sugars are fully developed, which provides the Texture to the puree. We use **White Pepper** and a pinch of **Nutmeg** as the mandatory high notes to bridge the gap between the earthy potatoes and the rich cream.

## Directions

1.  **The Sweat:** Set Instant Pot to "Sauté." Add butter and olive oil. Once hot, add leeks and sauté for 5-7 minutes until soft. Do not brown.
2.  **Aromatics:** Add garlic and sauté for 30 seconds. Sprinkle the flour over the leeks and stir for 1 minute to cook out the raw starch taste.
3.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the broth slowly, scraping the bottom of the pot to ensure no flour sticks.
4.  **Pressure:** Add potatoes, bay leaf, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Secure the lid. Set to **High Pressure for 7 minutes**.
5.  **Release:** Let the pressure release naturally for 15 minutes (mandatory for potato texture), then vent any remaining steam.
6.  **The Emulsion:** Remove the bay leaf. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup directly in the pot until perfectly smooth.
7.  **Finish:** Stir in the half-and-half. Taste and adjust salt if needed.
8.  **Serve:** Garnish with a dollop of sour cream and fresh chives for **Textural Balance**.
