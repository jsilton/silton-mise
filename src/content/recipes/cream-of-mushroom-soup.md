## Directions

1. In a large pot, melt butter. Add mushrooms and saute until golden, about 5-7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and remove 1 cup of the mushrooms, reserving them to the side.
2. Add shallot and garlic to the pot and saute until fragrant, 1 minute. Add thyme and vegetable stock and bring to a simmer. Cook until mushrooms are tender, about 8-10 minutes. Using an immersion blender, or working in batches in a regular blender, puree soup until smooth.
3. Return soup to pot and stir in cream and reserved mushrooms. Serve.
