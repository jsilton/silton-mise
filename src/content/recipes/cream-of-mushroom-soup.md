## Chef's Note

Sear mushrooms in butter until golden rather than boiling them to gray mush. Reserve a cup of seared mushrooms to stir in at the end for textural contrast against the smooth, pureed soup. Dry sherry's acidity and nuttiness bridges earthy shiitakes and rich cream beautifully.

## Directions

1.  **The Sear:** In a large heavy-bottomed pot, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add all mushrooms. Sauté undisturbed for 3 minutes to develop a crust, then stir and cook for 5 more minutes until golden.
2.  **Reserve:** Remove 1 cup of the seared mushrooms and set aside for the garnish.
3.  **Aromatics:** Add shallot and garlic to the pot. Sauté for 1 minute until fragrant. Stir in the thyme, salt, and pepper.
4.  **Simmer:** Pour in the vegetable stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes until mushrooms are very tender.
5.  **The Emulsion:** Using an immersion blender (or a regular blender in batches), puree the soup until completely smooth and velvety.
6.  **Finish:** Stir in the heavy cream and the **Dry Sherry**. Simmer for 1 more minute.
7.  **Serve:** Ladle into bowls and top with the **Reserved Seared Mushrooms** for texture.
