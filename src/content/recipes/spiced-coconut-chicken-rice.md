## Chef's Note

Soaking basmati rice for 45 minutes hydrates the grains before cooking, ensuring they elongate properly and stay separate rather than clumping into a sticky mass. Covering the pot with a kitchen towel under the lid absorbs excess steam, creating creamy rice from the coconut milk while maintaining individual grain integrity—a technique used in Persian and Indian rice cooking.

## Directions

1.  **The Soak:** Rinse rice 3 times until water is clear. Soak in cool water for 45 minutes. Drain.
2.  **Foundation:** In a large heavy pot, sauté shallots and garlic in oil until golden (3 mins).
3.  **The Bloom:** Add chicken, turmeric, cayenne, and salt. Sauté for 2 minutes until spices are toasted and chicken is opaque.
4.  **Braise:** Pour in 3/4 cup water. Simmer on low, covered, for 20 minutes until chicken is tender.
5.  **The Bind:** Add the drained rice, coconut milk, and remaining salt. Stir once.
6.  **The Towel:** Bring to a boil. Place a clean kitchen towel over the pot, then secure the lid. Reduce heat to **lowest setting**. Cook for 15 minutes.
7.  **Wilt:** Remove from heat. Layer the kale ribbons over the rice. Cover and let stand for 10 minutes (The Steam Cycle).
8.  **Serve:** Fluff the rice and chicken together. Serve with pickled chiles and lime wedges for the final **High Note**.
