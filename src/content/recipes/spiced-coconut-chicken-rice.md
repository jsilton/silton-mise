## Directions

1. Place rice in a medium bowl and pour in cold water to cover. Agitate rice with your hands until water is cloudy. Drain and repeat until water is almost clear (about 3 times). Pour in water to cover rice by 2"; let soak 30–45 minutes.
2. Heat oil in a heavy pot with a wide base (preferably 10") over medium-high. Add shallot and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring until softened, about 1 minute.
3. Add chicken, turmeric, cayenne, and 1½ tsp. salt. Cook, turning and moving around chicken thighs as needed, until chicken begins to turn opaque, about 2 minutes. Pour in ¾ cup water and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer, turning chicken once, until chicken is cooked through and very tender, about 20 minutes.
4. Drain rice and add to pot with chicken, then add coconut milk and remaining 1 tsp. salt. Stir to incorporate and bring to a boil. Drape a kitchen towel over pot; cover with lid. Bring corners of towel up and over lid and secure with a rubber band. Reduce heat to lowest setting and cook, undisturbed, 15 minutes.
5. Remove from heat and remove towel and lid. Arrange kale in an even layer over chicken and rice and cover with lid. Let sit until wilted, about 10 minutes.
6. Divide chicken and rice among bowls. Top with chiles if using. Serve with lime wedges.
