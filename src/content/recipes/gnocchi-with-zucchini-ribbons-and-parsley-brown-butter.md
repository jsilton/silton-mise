## Chef's Note

Brown butter (beurre noisette in French, literally "hazelnut butter") is a classic Italian and French technique where you cook butter until milk solids turn golden and release nutty aroma. Use a vegetable peeler to shave zucchini into paper-thin ribbons so they wilt quickly. Cherry tomatoes release just enough moisture to help brown butter coat the gnocchi. Nutmeg is traditional in Italian cooking with butter and herbs.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi until they float (3-5 mins). Drain.
2.  **Brown:** Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Cook for 2 minutes until it stops foaming and turns golden brown with a nutty aroma.
3.  **Aromatics:** Add shallots and zucchini ribbons. Sauté for 2 minutes, tossing constantly until just wilted.
4.  **Emulsify:** Add halved tomatoes, salt, nutmeg, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes until the tomatoes just begin to release their juices and form a light sauce.
5.  **Toss:** Add the drained gnocchi, Parmesan, and parsley to the skillet.
6.  **Bind:** Toss vigorously for 30 seconds until the cheese is melted and the gnocchi is glossy and coated. Serve immediately.
