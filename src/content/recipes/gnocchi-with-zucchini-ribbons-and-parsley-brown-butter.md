## Chef's Note

This is a 20-minute quick masterpiece. The secret to the Kitchen Standard is **Textural Balance** through **The Ribbon Method**: by shaving the zucchini with a vegetable peeler into paper-thin strips, we ensure it wilts in seconds, creating a "silk" that intertwines with the gnocchi. We use a **Brown Butter Emulsion**: we cook the butter until it hits its nutty peak (Beurre Noisette) then use the moisture from the cherry tomatoes to bind it into a glossy sauce. The **Nutmeg** provides the mandatory "High Note" that bridges the earthy brown butter and fresh parsley.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi until they float (3-5 mins). Drain.
2.  **Brown:** Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Cook for 2 minutes until it stops foaming and turns golden brown with a nutty aroma.
3.  **Aromatics:** Add shallots and zucchini ribbons. Sauté for 2 minutes, tossing constantly until just wilted.
4.  **Emulsify:** Add halved tomatoes, salt, nutmeg, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes until the tomatoes just begin to release their juices and form a light sauce.
5.  **Toss:** Add the drained gnocchi, Parmesan, and parsley to the skillet.
6.  **Bind:** Toss vigorously for 30 seconds until the cheese is melted and the gnocchi is glossy and coated. Serve immediately.
