## Chef's Note
This is a **Modern Heritage** update to the classic chocolate muffin. We use **Beet Puree** as a structural hydrator; it provides a deep, earthy moisture that keeps the muffins succulent for days without needing excessive oil. The secret to the Silton Standard here is **Texture Integrity**: the batter should be "Scoopable," not pourable. This ensures that the whole-wheat flour doesn't become gummy and the chocolate chips stay suspended rather than sinking to the bottom.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners or grease generously.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a large bowl, whisk beet puree, eggs, melted butter, honey, and brown sugar until smooth. Whisk in the milk.
3.  **Dry Mix:** Sift in the whole-wheat flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Fold gently with a spatula until **just combined**. If the batter is too dry to scoop, add 1 tbsp of milk at a time.
4.  **Fold:** Fold in the chocolate chips.
5.  **Fill:** Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups (about 3/4 full). Sprinkle a few extra chips on top for the "High Note" look.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 18-22 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
7.  **Cool:** Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a rack.
