## Directions

1. In a small bowl add the honey, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, red pepper, and mix until combined.
2. Place the peeled and deveined shrimp into a bowl and add 1/3 of the sauce.
3. Whisk in the cornstarch to the reserved marinade and set aside.
4. Heat a skillet (I use cast iron) or wok on high heat, add olive oil and broccoli, salt and pepper and cook 5-6 minutes just until soft. Remove from pan and set aside.
5. Add the butter to the skillet and add shrimp discarding any marinade. Cook until the shrimp turns pink about 2 minutes on each side.
6. Add in the reserved sauce and bring to a low-medium simmer until thickened about 2-3 minutes.
7. Add in the broccoli and toss until heated through.
8. Serve over rice or pasta

## Notes

Marinate the shrimp for 30 minutes for a deeper flavor.I like to use jumbo 16/20 size shrimp for this recipe, but you could use any size. The smaller ones will cook a bit faster depending on the size of your shrimp.I leave the shrimp tails on. It adds more flavor and looks prettier, but you can remove them if you want.I use fresh broccoli, but you can use frozen. Just make sure to thaw them first and pat them dry before cooking.
