## Chef's Note

This quick Chinese-American inspired stir-fry is done in 20 minutes. The trick: sear the shrimp in butter first and remove them before building the sauce, so they don't overcook while the honey reduces. Sear the broccoli separately until bright green and tender-crisp. The cornstarch in the sauce transforms the liquid into a glossy glaze that coats everything perfectly. Serve immediately over rice.

## Directions

1.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together honey, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, and 1 tsp cornstarch until smooth.
2.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet or wok, melt 1 tbsp butter. Add shrimp and sear for 2 minutes per side until pink. Remove to a plate immediately.
3.  **The Veg:** Add 1 tsp oil and the broccoli to the same pan. Sauté for 5-6 minutes until bright green and slightly softened at the edges. Remove and set aside.
4.  **Glaze:** Add the remaining 1 tbsp butter and the honey-garlic sauce to the pan. Bring to a low simmer for 2-3 minutes until thickened and glossy.
5.  **Bind:** Return the shrimp and broccoli to the skillet. Toss vigorously for 30 seconds until every piece is perfectly coated in the glaze.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately over [Basmati Rice](/silton-mise/recipes/basmati-rice).
