## Chef's Note

These Mexican-inspired tacos balance sweet mango with savory cumin-spiced shrimp. Briefly sautéing the mango with shrimp allows the fruit's sugars to release and create a tropical glaze when combined with lime juice. Fresh serrano chilies add bright heat that cuts through the sweet mango without overpowering.

## Directions

1.  **The Sear:** Heat oil in a heavy skillet or wok over medium-high. Add shrimp, garlic, and salt. Sauté for 2 minutes until they begin to turn pink.
2.  **The Pulse:** Add the ground cumin and Serrano chilies. Stir-fry for 1 minute until the spices are fragrant and the chilies are bright.
3.  **The Glaze:** Stir in the chopped mango and cilantro. Cook for exactly 1 minute—just until the mango starts to soften at the edges.
4.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Stir in the lime juice. Taste and adjust with extra salt.
5.  **Thermal Prep:** Wrap tortillas in a damp towel and microwave for 45 seconds (or char over an open flame).
6.  **Assemble:** Place 2 tortillas on each plate. Mound the shrimp-mango mixture into the center.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with a side of [Mexican Red Rice](/mise/recipes/mexican-red-rice).
