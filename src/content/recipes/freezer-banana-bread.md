## Chef's Note
This is the Gold Standard for **Modularity**. The secret to a perfect slice every morning is **The Freezer-Slice Pattern**: we use **Greek Yogurt** instead of butter to create a dense, high-moisture "Bounce" that specifically survives the freezing process without becoming crumbly. We use **The Blender Pattern** to pulverize the bananas and wet ingredients into a silky emulsion before folding in the flour—this ensures an even distribution of sweetness and prevents "mushy pockets."

## Directions

1.  **The Emulsion:** Preheat oven to 350°F. In a blender, combine bananas, maple syrup, vanilla, cinnamon, egg, yogurt, and milk. Blend on high for 30 seconds until perfectly smooth.
2.  **Dry Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk together the whole-wheat flour, baking soda, and baking powder.
3.  **Combine:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Stir with a spatula until **just combined** (do not over-mix, or the whole-wheat will turn tough).
4.  **Bake:** Pour into a greased loaf pan. Bake for 50-55 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
5.  **Cool:** Let cool in the pan for 15 minutes before slicing.
6.  **The Freeze:** To store, slice the loaf into 1/2-inch rounds. Place parchment between slices and freeze in a zip-top bag. Reheat individual slices in the toaster for a "Snap" finish.
