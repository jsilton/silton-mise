## Chef's Note

This is the "Universal Pickle." To get the restaurant-quality crunch, you **must salt the cucumbers first** and let them sit for 20 minutes to draw out excess water. This prevents the dressing from becoming watery and allows the flavors to penetrate the vegetable.

## Directions

1.  **Draw Moisture:** Toss the cucumber slices with 1 tsp salt in a colander. Let sit for 20 minutes.
2.  **Squeeze:** Rinse the cucumbers briefly under cold water, then squeeze them firmly with your hands or a clean kitchen towel to remove as much liquid as possible.
3.  **Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk together the gochugaru, vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, and green onions.
4.  **Toss:** Add the squeezed cucumbers to the bowl and toss to coat thoroughly.
5.  **Finish:** Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Let marinate for at least 10 minutes before serving.
