## Chef's Note

These are quick Korean pickles. To get the crisp texture, you must salt the cucumbers first and let them sit for 20 minutes to draw out excess water. This prevents the dressing from becoming watery and allows the flavors to penetrate the vegetable.

## Directions

1.  **Draw Moisture:** Toss the cucumber slices with 1 tsp salt in a colander. Let sit for 20 minutes.
2.  **Squeeze:** Rinse the cucumbers briefly under cold water, then squeeze them firmly with your hands or a clean kitchen towel to remove as much liquid as possible.
3.  **Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk together the gochugaru, vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, and green onions.
4.  **Toss:** Add the squeezed cucumbers to the bowl and toss to coat thoroughly.
5.  **Finish:** Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Let marinate for at least 10 minutes before serving.
