## Chef's Note

This tangy sauce balances the richness of Thanksgiving turkey and creamy sides. Fresh orange zest and juice create bright, aromatic flavor instead of just sweetness. You'll hear the cranberries pop as their natural pectin releases to thicken the sauce.

## Directions

1.  **Dissolve:** In a medium saucepan, combine the water, orange juice, orange zest, and sugar. Cook over medium heat until the sugar is completely dissolved.
2.  **Pop:** Stir in the fresh cranberries. Bring to a boil.
3.  **Simmer:** Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10-15 minutes. You will hear the cranberries "pop"—this is the pectin releasing to thicken the sauce.
4.  **Cool:** Remove from heat. The sauce will continue to thicken significantly as it cools.
5.  **Serve:** Serve at room temperature or chilled.
