## Chef's Note

This is the **Acid Balance** for your Thanksgiving plate. The heavy fat of the turkey and the creaminess of the gratin need the sharp, citrusy lift of this sauce to reset the palate. By using fresh zest and juice rather than just water, we ensure the sauce is bright and aromatic rather than just sweet.

## Directions

1.  **Dissolve:** In a medium saucepan, combine the water, orange juice, orange zest, and sugar. Cook over medium heat until the sugar is completely dissolved.
2.  **Pop:** Stir in the fresh cranberries. Bring to a boil.
3.  **Simmer:** Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10-15 minutes. You will hear the cranberries "pop"—this is the pectin releasing to thicken the sauce.
4.  **Cool:** Remove from heat. The sauce will continue to thicken significantly as it cools.
5.  **Serve:** Serve at room temperature or chilled.
