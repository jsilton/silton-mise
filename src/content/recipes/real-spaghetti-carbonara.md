## Chef's Note

Real Carbonara is a feat of **Emulsion Science**. There is NO cream in this dish. The "sauce" is a stable emulsion of egg yolks, melted fat, and starchy pasta water. The secret to success is the **Double Boiler Method**: by mixing the eggs and cheese in a bowl set over the boiling pasta water, you gently temper the eggs so they become creamy rather than scrambled.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta for 1 minute **less** than package instructions.
2.  **Render:** While pasta boils, sauté the guanciale/pancetta in a large skillet over medium heat until the fat has rendered and the meat is crispy. Remove from heat.
3.  **The Temper:** In a medium stainless steel or glass bowl, whisk the eggs, cheese, and pepper. Place the bowl over the pot of boiling pasta for 1 minute (like a double boiler), whisking constantly until the mixture is warm and the cheese starts to melt.
4.  **Bind:** Reserve 1 cup of starchy pasta water. Drain the pasta.
5.  **Toss:** Add the hot pasta to the skillet with the rendered fat. Pour the warm egg/cheese mixture over the pasta.
6.  **Emulsify:** Add 1/4 cup of pasta water. Toss vigorously and constantly. The heat from the pasta will finish cooking the eggs into a silky, glossy sauce. Add more water if it looks too thick.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with extra Pecorino and pepper.
