## Chef's Note

Chicken meatballs can dry out easily since ground chicken is so lean, but adding Greek yogurt and panko keeps them moist and tender. This one-pot method borrows from Italian-American home cooking: brown the meatballs first for flavor, then pile greens and lemon slices on top to steam together. The lemon brightens everything while the chard stays vibrant and tender.

## Directions

1.  **The Mix:** In a large bowl, combine chicken, yogurt, panko, garlic, scallions, and herbs. Mix **gently** until just combined.
2.  **Shape:** Coat your palms in oil. Form the mixture into 14 uniform balls (about 2 inches each).
3.  **The Sear:** Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large pot over medium. Sauté meatballs for 7 minutes until golden on all sides.
4.  **The Layer:** In a separate bowl, toss the chard with cumin, salt, and 2 tbsp oil.
5.  **The Braise:** Pile the chard and lemon slices directly on top of the meatballs. Cover tightly.
6.  **Cook:** Simmer for 12-15 minutes until the meatballs are cooked through (165°F) and the chard is tender.
7.  **Serve:** Use a ladle to scoop meatballs and greens together. Squeeze the remaining lemon half over the top for the mandatory **High Note**.
