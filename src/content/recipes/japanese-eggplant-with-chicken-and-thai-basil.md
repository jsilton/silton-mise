## Chef's Note

This Thai-style stir-fry uses velveting - massaging water and cornstarch into chicken breast - to keep lean meat tender during high-heat cooking. Japanese eggplant is seared covered in an oiled wok, which steams the interior while the skin gets golden-brown. Thai basil added at the end provides aromatic, peppery lift.

## Directions

1.  **Velvet:** Massage water into the chicken slices until absorbed. Toss with cornstarch and soy sauce. Let sit for 10 minutes.
2.  **The Sear:** Heat 2 tbsp oil in a wok over medium-high. Add eggplant. Cover and sear for 2 minutes. Flip, add 1 tbsp oil, and cover for 2 more minutes until tender. Transfer to a plate.
3.  **The Crunch:** Heat 1 tbsp oil until smoking. Sear chicken for 1 minute per side until browned. Remove and set aside.
4.  **Aromatics:** Add 1 tbsp oil, garlic, and scallion whites. Sauté for 30 seconds. Add the basil leaves and stir until they start to wilt.
5.  **Bind:** Return chicken and eggplant to the wok. Splash in the Shaoxing wine. Add the fish sauce, soy sauces, sugar, and white pepper.
6.  **Glaze:** Pour the hot stock around the perimeter of the wok to deglaze. Toss vigorously until the liquid is absorbed into a glossy glaze.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately over steamed jasmine rice.
