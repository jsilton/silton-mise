## Chef's Note
The key to this 30-minute "Fuel" dish is **Structural Science** through **Velveting**. By massaging water and cornstarch into the chicken breast, we create a barrier that keeps the lean meat succulent during the high-heat stir-fry. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The Perimeter Sear Pattern**: we sear the eggplant in an oiled wok with the lid on—this "dry-steams" the interior while the skin gets a golden-brown "Snap." The Thai basil provides the mandatory aromatic **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **Velvet:** Massage water into the chicken slices until absorbed. Toss with cornstarch and soy sauce. Let sit for 10 minutes.
2.  **The Sear:** Heat 2 tbsp oil in a wok over medium-high. Add eggplant. Cover and sear for 2 minutes. Flip, add 1 tbsp oil, and cover for 2 more minutes until tender. Transfer to a plate.
3.  **The Snap:** Heat 1 tbsp oil until smoking. Sear chicken for 1 minute per side until browned. Remove and set aside.
4.  **Aromatics:** Add 1 tbsp oil, garlic, and scallion whites. Sauté for 30 seconds. Add the basil leaves and stir until they start to wilt.
5.  **Bind:** Return chicken and eggplant to the wok. Splash in the Shaoxing wine. Add the fish sauce, soy sauces, sugar, and white pepper.
6.  **Glaze:** Pour the hot stock around the perimeter of the wok to deglaze. Toss vigorously until the liquid is absorbed into a glossy glaze. 
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately over steamed jasmine rice.
