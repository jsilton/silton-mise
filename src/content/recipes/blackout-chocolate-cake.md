## Chef's Note

This is a masterpiece of **Flavor Layering**. To get the "Blackout" depth, we use **Boiling Water and Espresso** to bloom the cocoa powder. The intense heat releases the oils in the cacao, resulting in a dark, fudgy crumb that chocolate alone cannot achieve. The Greek yogurt provides the acidity needed to react with the baking soda for a massive rise.

## Directions

1.  **Bloom:** In a large bowl, whisk the boiling water with the cocoa powder and espresso powder. Let it sit for 2 minutes to bloom the chocolate.
2.  **Wet:** Whisk in the yogurt, oil, eggs, and vanilla until smooth.
3.  **Dry:** In a separate bowl, whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt.
4.  **Combine:** Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the chocolate liquid.
5.  **Bake:** Pour into three 9-inch lined pans. Bake at 350°F for 30-35 minutes. Cool completely.
6.  **Frost:** Use a rich chocolate ganache or cream cheese frosting.
