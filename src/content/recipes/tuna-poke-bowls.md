## Chef's Note

The quality of a poke bowl lives and dies by the **Tuna sourcing**. Always look for "Sashimi-Grade" or "Sushi-Grade" labeling. To prevent the fish from turning "mushy," toss it with the dressing only 5-10 minutes before serving. We use the [Korean Pickled Cucumbers](/mise/recipes/korean-pickled-cucumbers) to add an essential acidic snap that balances the fatty tuna and avocado.

## Directions

1.  **Rice:** Prepare your rice and keep it at room temperature (not ice cold).
2.  **The Fish:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the dressing ingredients. Gently fold in the tuna cubes. Let marinate in the fridge for 10 minutes.
3.  **Components:** Prepare your avocado, edamame, and scallions. Ensure your [Korean Pickled Cucumbers](/mise/recipes/korean-pickled-cucumbers) are drained and cold.
4.  **Assemble:** Place a mound of rice in each bowl. Arrange the tuna, avocado, cucumbers, and edamame in sections on top.
5.  **Finish:** Top with nori strips, scallions, and sesame seeds. Serve with extra soy sauce or spicy mayo on the side.
