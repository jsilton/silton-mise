## Directions

1. Start the rice in a rice cooker. After 20 mins, add the chinese sausage wrapped in aluminum foil on top of the rice and complete cooking.
2. Heat half the oil in a wok on high heat until it sizzles when sprinkling water. Add the broccoli, season with salt, and saute until mostly cooked (bright green color throughout). Remove brocoli from the wok and set aside to add back later.
3. Heat the second half of the oil on high heat. Add the onions and garlic and saute for 1 minute. Then add the chicken and season with salt and pepper. Cook the chicken on high until the outside is cooked.
4. Add the dry sherry and simmer for 1 minute. Then add half of the water and bring to a boil. Add the remaining half of the water, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and return to a boil.
5. Taste and adjust seasoning, then add corn starch until thickened. Mix in brocoili and simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Remove chinese sausage from rice, cut into 1/4 inch slices, and drizzle with soy sauce on a side dish.
7. Serve chinese chicken over rice with chinese sausage on the side.
