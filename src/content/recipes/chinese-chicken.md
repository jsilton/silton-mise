## Chef's Note

This one-pot meal showcases lap cheong, sweet Cantonese sausages made with pork, sugar, and rose wine. The clever technique: steam the sausages directly on top of the rice as it cooks. The fat renders into the rice while keeping your stir-fry clean. Searing the broccoli separately first ensures it stays bright green and crisp. The sherry-soy sauce thickened with cornstarch creates a restaurant-style glossy glaze.

## Directions

1.  **The Rice Hack:** Rinse rice and start in a rice cooker. After 20 minutes, place the Chinese sausage (wrapped in foil or directly on top) onto the steaming rice. Complete the cycle.
2.  **Snap:** Heat oil in a wok until shimmering. Add broccoli and a pinch of salt. Sauté until bright green and slightly tender (3 mins). Remove broccoli and set aside.
3.  **Sear:** Add fresh oil. Sauté onions and garlic for 1 minute. Add chicken and season with salt and pepper. Cook on high heat until the exterior is browned.
4.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the dry sherry and simmer for 1 minute to reduce. Add 3 cups water, soy sauce, and oyster sauce. Bring to a boil.
5.  **Bind:** Whisk the cornstarch slurry and stir into the wok. Simmer for 5 minutes until the sauce is thick and glossy. Fold the broccoli back in.
6.  **Serve:** Remove sausage from the rice and slice into 1/4-inch coins. Serve the chicken over the fragrant rice with the sausage slices on the side.
