## Chef's Note

Reducing soy-mirin-vinegar until it becomes heavy syrup, then brushing it onto trout in multiple layers under the broiler creates a mahogany-colored, crispy glaze that contrasts delicate, flaky meat. Poaching julienned vegetables in dashi for exactly 1 minute keeps them crisp while infusing them with clean, oceanic flavor that balances the rich glaze.

## Directions

1.  **The Glaze:** In a small saucepan, bring soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and vinegar to a boil. Simmer for 10 minutes until reduced by half and thick enough to coat a spoon.
2.  **The Bath:** In a separate pot, bring [Dashi](/mise/recipes/dashi-japanese-sea-stock) to a boil. Add carrots and leeks. Simmer for exactly 1 minute. Remove vegetables with a slotted spoon and set aside. Keep dashi warm.
3.  **Thermal Prep:** Preheat the broiler. Arrange trout fillets, skin-side up, on a sturdy baking sheet.
4.  **The Lacquer:** Broil for 2 minutes until the skin sizzles. Carefully peel off and discard the skin. Brush the meat with the glaze.
5.  **Stage 2:** Broil for 3 minutes, brushing twice more with the lacquer, until the trout is cooked through and the surface is mirror-glossy.
6.  **Assemble:** Mound rice in shallow bowls. Top with the glazed trout, nori, and the poached vegetables.
7.  **Serve:** Carefully pour the hot dashi around the perimeter of the bowl. Serve immediately.
