## Chef's Note
This is a masterclass in **Modern Heritage** aesthetics. The secret to its professional finish is **Texture Integrity** through **The Dashi Lacquer Pattern**: we reduce the soy-mirin-vinegar mixture until it becomes a heavy syrup, then brush it onto the trout in multiple layers while under the broiler. This creates a mahogany-colored, "Snappy" skin that contrasts the delicate, flaky meat. We use **The Dashi Bath**: the julienned vegetables are poached in dashi for exactly 1 minute, ensuring they provide a clean, oceanic **High Note** to balance the rich glaze.

## Directions

1.  **The Glaze:** In a small saucepan, bring soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and vinegar to a boil. Simmer for 10 minutes until reduced by half and thick enough to coat a spoon.
2.  **The Bath:** In a separate pot, bring [Dashi](/recipes/dashi-japanese-sea-stock) to a boil. Add carrots and leeks. Simmer for exactly 1 minute. Remove vegetables with a slotted spoon and set aside. Keep dashi warm.
3.  **Thermal Prep:** Preheat the broiler. Arrange trout fillets, skin-side up, on a sturdy baking sheet.
4.  **The Lacquer:** Broil for 2 minutes until the skin sizzles. Carefully peel off and discard the skin. Brush the meat with the glaze. 
5.  **Stage 2:** Broil for 3 minutes, brushing twice more with the lacquer, until the trout is cooked through and the surface is mirror-glossy.
6.  **Assemble:** Mound rice in shallow bowls. Top with the glazed trout, nori, and the poached vegetables. 
7.  **Serve:** Carefully pour the hot dashi around the perimeter of the bowl. Serve immediately.
