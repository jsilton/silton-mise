## Chef's Note

Slicing spinach into thin ribbons (chiffonade) prevents large, wet clumps in the finished muffins - the leaves wilt evenly into the egg. Fresh bell pepper adds crisp texture that contrasts with rich egg and melted cheddar. These keep refrigerated for 4 days and reheat in 30 seconds.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Spray a standard muffin tin generously with cooking spray.
2.  **The Base:** In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and milk until very frothy. Season with salt and pepper.
3.  **The Veg:** Finely dice the red pepper. To chiffonade the spinach: stack the leaves, roll them tightly like a cigar, and slice thin ribbons.
4.  **Combine:** Fold the peppers, spinach, and shredded cheese into the egg mixture.
5.  **Fill:** Pour the mixture into the muffin cups, filling each about 3/4 full.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 20-25 minutes until the centers are set and the tops are slightly golden.
7.  **Cool:** Allow to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before removing. These can be refrigerated for up to 4 days and reheated for 30 seconds in the microwave.
