## Chef's Note

Slap the thyme sprig sharply in your palm before garnishing - this ruptures oil glands and releases the herb's essence without the bitterness of muddling. Add Prosecco only after shaking and straining the base so bubbles stay effervescent, cutting through smoky mezcal and rich cognac. Express lemon peel over the rim for aromatic oils.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Chill a large coupe or wine glass in the freezer for 10 minutes.
2.  **The Base:** Combine gin, mezcal, cognac, lemon juice, Benedictine, agave, and orange bitters in a shaker filled with large ice cubes.
3.  **Aeration:** Shake vigorously for 15 seconds until the shaker is frosted and the mixture is perfectly emulsified.
4.  **Strain:** Double strain into the chilled glass to ensure a silky mouthfeel.
5.  **The Crown:** Top with the chilled Prosecco. Do not stir—let the bubbles naturally integrate the layers.
6.  **The Slap:** Take the thyme sprig, slap it between your palms, and place it in the glass. Express the lemon peel over the rim and drop it in for the mandatory **High Note**.
