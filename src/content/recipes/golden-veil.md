## Chef's Note

The Golden Veil is a masterclass in **Structural Science** and flavor layering. The secret to its aromatic complexity is **The Slap Pattern**: you must place the thyme sprig in your palm and slap it sharply before garnishing; this ruptures the oil glands, releasing the herb's essence without the bitterness of muddling. We use **The Effervescence Layering Pattern**: the Prosecco is added only after the base is shaken and strained, ensuring the "Bounce" of the bubbles is preserved to cut through the smoky mezcal and rich cognac.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Chill a large coupe or wine glass in the freezer for 10 minutes.
2.  **The Base:** Combine gin, mezcal, cognac, lemon juice, Benedictine, agave, and orange bitters in a shaker filled with large ice cubes.
3.  **Aeration:** Shake vigorously for 15 seconds until the shaker is frosted and the mixture is perfectly emulsified.
4.  **Strain:** Double strain into the chilled glass to ensure a silky mouthfeel.
5.  **The Crown:** Top with the chilled Prosecco. Do not stir—let the bubbles naturally integrate the layers.
6.  **The Slap:** Take the thyme sprig, slap it between your palms, and place it in the glass. Express the lemon peel over the rim and drop it in for the mandatory **High Note**.
