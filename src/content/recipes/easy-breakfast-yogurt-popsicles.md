## Chef's Note
These are the ultimate **Modularity** component for hot summer mornings. We treat these as a "Base" because they can be prepped 5 days in advance. The secret to **Texture Integrity** is the **Honey Glide Pattern**: we microwave the honey for 10 seconds before mixing it with the granola—this ensures a thin, even coating that maintains its "Snap" even when frozen in yogurt. Always run the mold under hot water for 5 seconds to ensure a clean "Bounce" from the mold.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** Whisk together the milk, yogurt, and 1 tsp of the honey until smooth and creamy.
2.  **Fruit:** Divide the fresh berries evenly among your popsicle molds.
3.  **Fill:** Pour the yogurt mixture into the molds, leaving a 1/2-inch gap at the top.
4.  **The Snap:** Microwave the remaining 1 tsp honey for 10 seconds. Toss with the granola until coated. Press the granola mixture into the top of each popsicle mold to create a crunchy "base."
5.  **Set:** Place a wooden stick into each mold. Freeze for **at least 4 hours** (overnight is best).
6.  **Unmold:** Run the outside of the mold under warm water for 5-10 seconds to release. Serve immediately.
