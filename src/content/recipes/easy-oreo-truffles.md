## Chef's Note

Chill rolled truffle balls for at least 30 minutes before dipping in melted chocolate - the temperature contrast creates an immediate shell that prevents the truffle from melting into the coating. Reserve a few cookies for garnish to add textural contrast against smooth chocolate.

## Directions

1.  **The Crumbs:** Reserve 9 cookies. Pulse the remaining 36 cookies in a food processor until they are fine, sandy crumbs.
2.  **The Bind:** In a large bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and cookie crumbs until completely combined and a dark, uniform dough forms.
3.  **Shape:** Roll the mixture into 1-inch balls (about 42 total). Place on a parchment-lined tray.
4.  **The Finish:** Refrigerate the balls for **at least 30-60 minutes** until very firm.
5.  **The Melt:** Melt the baking chocolate in a heatproof bowl over simmering water (or in the microwave in 30-second bursts).
6.  **Dip:** Using a fork or dipping tool, submerge each cold ball into the chocolate. Tap off the excess.
7.  **Garnish:** Immediately sprinkle with the crushed reserved cookies (and a pinch of sea salt for the **Acid/Salt Finish**) while the chocolate is still wet.
8.  **Finish:** Refrigerate for 1 hour to set the shell. Store in the fridge.
