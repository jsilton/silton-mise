## Chef's Note

Roast potatoes at 400°F, cut-side down for maximum crust. Add minced garlic only during the final 10 minutes or toss with fresh garlic at the end - this prevents burning and keeps garlic sweet and aromatic. Toss with fresh parsley while oil is still hot to release herb oils.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2.  **Toss:** In a large bowl, combine potatoes, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Toss vigorously until every piece is heavily coated.
3.  **Arrange:** Spread the potatoes in a **single layer**, cut-side down. This maximizes the Crunch of the crust.
4.  **Roast:** Bake for 45-50 minutes. Flip with a spatula twice during cooking to ensure even browning.
5.  **The Garlic Finish:** 5 minutes before the end of roasting, sprinkle the minced garlic over the potatoes and toss.
6.  **Garnish:** Remove from the oven. Toss immediately with fresh parsley while the oil is still sizzling to release the herb's oils.
