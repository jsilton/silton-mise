## Chef's Note

The secret to "Gold Standard" roasted potatoes is **Texture Integrity** through the **Steam-Off Pattern**. Most recipes roast potatoes raw; we roast them at high heat (400°F) and ensure they are **bone-dry** before hitting the oil. The critical Silton move is adding the **minced garlic** only during the final 10 minutes or as a fresh toss at the end; this prevents the garlic from burning and turning bitter, ensuring a sweet, aromatic "High Note" finish.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2.  **Toss:** In a large bowl, combine potatoes, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Toss vigorously until every piece is heavily coated.
3.  **Arrange:** Spread the potatoes in a **single layer**, cut-side down. This maximizes the "Snap" of the crust.
4.  **Roast:** Bake for 45-50 minutes. Flip with a spatula twice during cooking to ensure even browning.
5.  **The Garlic Finish:** 5 minutes before the end of roasting, sprinkle the minced garlic over the potatoes and toss.
6.  **Garnish:** Remove from the oven. Toss immediately with fresh parsley while the oil is still sizzling to release the herb's oils.
