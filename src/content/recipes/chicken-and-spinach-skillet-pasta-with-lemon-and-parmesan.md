## Chef's Note

This represents the lighter side of Italian-American cooking that emerged in the 2000s as Americans became more health-conscious. Traditional Italian cooking often relies on butter and cream, but this technique uses starchy pasta water to create body and cling without the heaviness. Lemon is huge in Southern Italian coastal cooking, especially in Amalfi and Sicily. One bag of spinach looks massive but wilts down to almost nothing - don't be afraid to use the full amount. This is best eaten immediately as the sauce doesn't reheat well.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water until **very al dente** (2 minutes less than package). **Reserve 1 cup of pasta water.**
2.  **Sear:** While pasta boils, heat oil in a large skillet. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Sear for 5-7 minutes until golden and cooked through. Remove to a plate.
3.  **Aromatics:** Add garlic to the pan for 30 seconds. Pour in the wine, lemon juice, and zest. Simmer for 2 minutes to reduce.
4.  **Toss:** Add the hot pasta and 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water to the pan. Add the chicken and the spinach.
5.  **Bind:** Toss vigorously over medium heat. The spinach will wilt in seconds. Stir in the Parmesan. Add more pasta water if needed until the sauce is glossy and coats the noodles.
6.  **Serve:** Garnish with extra Parmesan and black pepper.
