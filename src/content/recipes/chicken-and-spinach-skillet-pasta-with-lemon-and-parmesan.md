## Chef's Note

This is a high-performance weeknight meal that relies on **The Emulsion Method**. Instead of a heavy cream sauce, we use the starchy pasta water and white wine to bind the lemon and parmesan into a light, silky glaze. The massive amount of spinach provides the nutritious without making the dish feel heavy. Always finish with fresh lemon zest for that **High Note** brightness.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water until **very al dente** (2 minutes less than package). **Reserve 1 cup of pasta water.**
2.  **Sear:** While pasta boils, heat oil in a large skillet. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Sear for 5-7 minutes until golden and cooked through. Remove to a plate.
3.  **Aromatics:** Add garlic to the pan for 30 seconds. Pour in the wine, lemon juice, and zest. Simmer for 2 minutes to reduce.
4.  **Toss:** Add the hot pasta and 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water to the pan. Add the chicken and the spinach.
5.  **Bind:** Toss vigorously over medium heat. The spinach will wilt in seconds. Stir in the Parmesan. Add more pasta water if needed until the sauce is glossy and coats the noodles.
6.  **Serve:** Garnish with extra Parmesan and black pepper.
