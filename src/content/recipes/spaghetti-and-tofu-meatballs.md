## Chef's Note

The secret to meatless meatballs that aren't mushy is **Culinary Technique** through **The Walnut-Starch Bind**. By combining pressed tofu with ground walnuts and whole-wheat crumbs, we create a multi-dimensional Crunch that mimics beef. We maintain **Textural Balance** by sautéing the mirepoix vegetables until tender _before_ adding them to the tofu; this ensures the "meatballs" set firmly in the oven. The Dijon mustard provides the mandatory **Acid Balance** needed to bridge the earthy soy and nutty walnuts.

## Directions

1.  **Foundation:** In a large skillet, sauté onion, carrot, pepper, and garlic in olive oil for 10 minutes until soft. Let cool slightly.
2.  **The Base:** In a massive bowl, crumble the pressed tofu with your hands until it looks like ground meat.
3.  **Emulsify:** Add the eggs, breadcrumbs, walnuts, herbs, mustard, sesame oil, and soy sauce to the tofu.
4.  **Combine:** Add the sautéed vegetables. Mix vigorously with your hands until a sticky, uniform dough forms.
5.  **Shape:** Form into 1.5-inch balls. Arrange on an oiled baking sheet.
6.  **Bake:** Bake at 350°F for 20-30 minutes, flipping once, until the exterior is deep brown and "Snappy."
7.  **Serve:** Add the meatballs to your favorite [Roasted Tomato Sauce](/silton-mise/recipes/roasted-tomato-basil-soup) and serve over [Fresh Egg Pasta](/silton-mise/recipes/fresh-egg-pasta).
