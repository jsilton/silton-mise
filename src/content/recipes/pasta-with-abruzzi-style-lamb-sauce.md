## Chef's Note

This ragù comes from Abruzzo, the mountainous region in central Italy where sheep farming has been a way of life for centuries. Abruzzese cuisine is rustic and hearty, designed to sustain shepherds in the mountains. Traditional lamb ragù starts with pancetta to render fat and add smokiness, then builds with white wine (not red) and rosemary, which grows wild in the Apennine mountains. Hand-crushing the tomatoes gives a chunkier, more rustic texture than smooth tomato sauce. Pecorino Romano (sheep's milk cheese) is the traditional finishing cheese in this region - it's sharper and saltier than Parmigiano-Reggiano. Dice the lamb yourself rather than buying pre-ground for better texture.

## Directions

1.  **Render:** Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Add the onion and pancetta. Cook until the pancetta fat has melted and the onions are gold (8 mins).
2.  **Sear:** Add the diced lamb and rosemary. Season with salt and pepper. Brown the meat aggressively until it develops a crust.
3.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the white wine. Scrape the bottom of the pan to release the fond. Simmer until the wine has evaporated by 75%.
4.  **Simmer:** Add the crushed tomatoes and their juices. Reduce heat to low and simmer gently for 30-40 minutes until the sauce is thick and the fat starts to separate.
5.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water until al dente.
6.  **Combine:** Toss the hot pasta directly into the lamb sauce. Add the Pecorino and toss to coat.
7.  **Serve:** Serve with extra cheese and a crack of black pepper.
