## Chef's Note

This is a soulful, rustic ragu from the Abruzzo region of Italy. Unlike a beef bolognese, lamb ragu relies on the **Rendering of Fat**: we start by rendering the pancetta fat to provide a smoky base for the lamb. Dicing the lamb finely instead of using generic "ground meat" provides a superior, meaty texture. The white wine and rosemary provide a forest-like aroma that cuts the richness of the lamb.

## Directions

1.  **Render:** Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Add the onion and pancetta. Cook until the pancetta fat has melted and the onions are gold (8 mins).
2.  **Sear:** Add the diced lamb and rosemary. Season with salt and pepper. Brown the meat aggressively until it develops a crust.
3.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the white wine. Scrape the bottom of the pan to release the fond. Simmer until the wine has evaporated by 75%.
4.  **Simmer:** Add the crushed tomatoes and their juices. Reduce heat to low and simmer gently for 30-40 minutes until the sauce is thick and the fat starts to separate.
5.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water until al dente.
6.  **Combine:** Toss the hot pasta directly into the lamb sauce. Add the Pecorino and toss to coat.
7.  **Serve:** Serve with extra cheese and a crack of black pepper.
