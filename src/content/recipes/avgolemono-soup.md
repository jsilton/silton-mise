## Chef's Note

Avgolemono is a miracle of **Tempering Science**. It is incredibly creamy and rich, yet contains zero dairy. The "Sauce" is created by slowly whisking hot broth into cold eggs and lemon juice, which stabilizes the eggs so they thicken the soup without curdling. This is the ultimate comfort meal when you need a bright, healthy lift.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** In a large pot, bring the chicken broth to a boil. Add the rice (or orzo) and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for 15 minutes until tender.
2.  **Heat:** Stir in the shredded chicken and keep the soup at a very low simmer (do not boil once the chicken is in).
3.  **The Emulsion:** In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs vigorously for 2 minutes until foamy. Slowly whisk in the lemon juice.
4.  **Temper (Critical):** While whisking the egg-lemon mixture constantly, slowly ladle in 2 cups of the hot broth, one ladle at a time. This "warms up" the eggs so they don't scramble when they hit the pot.
5.  **Combine:** Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the large pot. Stir constantly over **low heat** for 2 minutes. The soup will instantly turn creamy and opaque.
6.  **Finish:** Season with salt and a generous amount of white pepper. Serve immediately.
