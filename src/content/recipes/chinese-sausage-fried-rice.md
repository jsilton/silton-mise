## Chef's Note

Fried rice is a Cantonese classic for using up leftover rice. The secret to separated grains instead of mushy clumps: use day-old refrigerated rice—fresh rice is too moist and sticky. Lap cheong (Chinese sausage) adds sweet-savory flavor. Cook the eggs into thin omelets first, then slice and fold them back in at the end—this keeps them bright yellow and distinct instead of coating the rice in a gray film.

## Directions

1.  **Prep Rice:** Use your fingers to break up any large clumps of the cold rice so the grains are distinct.
2.  **The Ribbons:** Whisk eggs with 1 tsp sesame oil. Heat 1 tsp peanut oil in a wok. Pour in 1/3 of the egg, swirl to coat, and cook until just set. Remove, roll up, and slice into thin ribbons. Repeat with remaining egg.
3.  **The Sear:** Add remaining peanut oil to the wok. Stir-fry the sausage slices for 2-3 minutes until the fat renders and the edges are crispy. Add green onions, garlic, and chili; stir-fry for 1 minute.
4.  **The Fry:** Increase heat to high. Add the rice. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, pressing the rice against the sides of the wok to "toast" it.
5.  **Season:** Add soy sauce, oyster sauce, peas, and the remaining sesame oil. Toss vigorously for 2 minutes until everything is heated through and the rice is coated in a glossy glaze.
6.  **Fold:** Gently fold the egg ribbons back into the rice. Serve immediately.
