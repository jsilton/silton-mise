## Chef's Note

The secret to "Grain Separation" in fried rice is **Texture Integrity**. You must use **Day-Old Rice** that has been refrigerated; fresh rice is too moist and will turn into mush in the wok. We use the **Egg Ribbon Pattern**: cooking the eggs into a thin omelet first, slicing them, and folding them back in at the end. This ensures the eggs maintain their "Bounce" and bright yellow color rather than coating the rice in a gray film.

## Directions

1.  **Prep Rice:** Use your fingers to break up any large clumps of the cold rice so the grains are distinct.
2.  **The Ribbons:** Whisk eggs with 1 tsp sesame oil. Heat 1 tsp peanut oil in a wok. Pour in 1/3 of the egg, swirl to coat, and cook until just set. Remove, roll up, and slice into thin ribbons. Repeat with remaining egg.
3.  **The Sear:** Add remaining peanut oil to the wok. Stir-fry the sausage slices for 2-3 minutes until the fat renders and the edges are crispy. Add green onions, garlic, and chili; stir-fry for 1 minute.
4.  **The Fry:** Increase heat to high. Add the rice. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, pressing the rice against the sides of the wok to "toast" it.
5.  **Season:** Add soy sauce, oyster sauce, peas, and the remaining sesame oil. Toss vigorously for 2 minutes until everything is heated through and the rice is coated in a glossy glaze.
6.  **Fold:** Gently fold the egg ribbons back into the rice. Serve immediately.
