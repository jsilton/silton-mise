## Chef's Note

Mongolian chicken follows the same Chinese-American formula as Mongolian beef. The trick to maximum crispiness: dredge chicken in cornstarch, let it sit until the starch absorbs moisture, then dredge again before frying. This creates a deep, crispy crust that holds up to the thick soy-sugar glaze. The final sauce should cling entirely to the meat with no liquid pooling in the bowl.

## Directions

1.  **Dredge:** Toss chicken with 1 tbsp oil, then coat heavily in 1/4 cup cornstarch. Let sit for 5 minutes until the starch is absorbed.
2.  **The Crunch:** Heat 1/3 cup oil in a wok until shimmering. Fry chicken pieces in a single layer for 1-2 minutes per side until browned and very crispy. Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate.
3.  **Aromatics:** Drain the oil, leaving 1 tbsp. Sauté ginger, garlic, chilies, and scallion whites for 20 seconds.
4.  **The Glaze:** Pour in the soy sauce, brown sugar, and hot stock. Bring to a rapid boil.
5.  **Bind:** Stir in the cornstarch slurry. Simmer for 2 minutes until the sauce is thick and mirror-glossy.
6.  **Toss:** Add the crispy chicken and scallion greens. Toss for 10 seconds until every piece is lacquered.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately over steamed rice.
