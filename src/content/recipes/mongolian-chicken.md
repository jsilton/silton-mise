## Chef's Note

This is the "Kitchen Standard" for Mongolian stir-fry. The secret to its elite texture is **Culinary Technique** through **The Velvet Crust Method**: we dredge the chicken in a thick layer of cornstarch and let it sit; if the starch becomes moist, we dredge it _again_. This ensures that when the chicken hits the high-heat oil, it develops a deep, crispy crust that can hold up to the heavy soy-sugar glaze. We use **The No-Liquid Glaze Method**: the final sauce should be so thick that it clings entirely to the meat, leaving no pool of liquid in the bowl.

## Directions

1.  **Dredge:** Toss chicken with 1 tbsp oil, then coat heavily in 1/4 cup cornstarch. Let sit for 5 minutes until the starch is absorbed.
2.  **The Crunch:** Heat 1/3 cup oil in a wok until shimmering. Fry chicken pieces in a single layer for 1-2 minutes per side until browned and very crispy. Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate.
3.  **Aromatics:** Drain the oil, leaving 1 tbsp. Sauté ginger, garlic, chilies, and scallion whites for 20 seconds.
4.  **The Glaze:** Pour in the soy sauce, brown sugar, and hot stock. Bring to a rapid boil.
5.  **Bind:** Stir in the cornstarch slurry. Simmer for 2 minutes until the sauce is thick and mirror-glossy.
6.  **Toss:** Add the crispy chicken and scallion greens. Toss for 10 seconds until every piece is lacquered.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately over steamed rice.
