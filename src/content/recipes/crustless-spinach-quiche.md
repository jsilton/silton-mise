## Chef's Note

This French-style quiche sautés onions over high heat until edges char and caramelize, adding smokiness that balances earthy spinach. Greek yogurt replaces heavy cream for a firmer, protein-rich custard that doesn't turn watery. Gruyère's nutty flavor is more complex than standard Swiss cheese.

## Directions

1.  **The Blacken:** In a large skillet, heat oil over high heat. Add the sliced onion and sauté for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until deeply browned and slightly charred at the edges.
2.  **The Wilt:** Add the spinach to the onions. Toss for 1 minute until just wilted. **Discard any excess liquid** from the pan.
3.  **The Custard:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, Greek yogurt, salt, and pepper until perfectly smooth.
4.  **Fold:** Stir the onion-spinach mixture and 3/4 of the Gruyère into the egg custard.
5.  **Bake:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray a 9-inch pie plate with oil. Pour the mixture into the plate and sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top.
6.  **Finish:** Bake for 25-30 minutes until the top is golden brown and the center is set.
7.  **Serve:** Serve warm or at room temperature with a side of greens.
