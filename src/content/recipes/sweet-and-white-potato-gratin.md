## Chef's Note

This is a rich, colorful holiday centerpiece. The secret to a perfect gratin is **Structural Integrity**: we use a mandolin to ensure the potato slices are paper-thin, allowing them to stack tightly and cook evenly. **Pro Tip:** For an even richer result, you can simmer the cream mixture with the garlic and herbs for 5 minutes before pouring it over the potatoes to "infuse" the fat.

## Directions

1.  **Infuse:** In a medium pot, whisk together the cream, salt, pepper, garlic, and spices. Warm over low heat (do not boil) just to marry the flavors.
2.  **Slice:** Use a mandolin to slice all potatoes into 1/8-inch thick rounds. Keep the colors separate for layering.
3.  **Cheese Mix:** Combine the shredded Gruyère and Parmesan in a bowl.
4.  **Layer:** Lightly butter a 9x13 baking dish. Pour 1/2 cup of the cream on the bottom.
    - Layer 1: Sweet potatoes (slightly overlapping). Drizzle with cream, sprinkle with cheese.
    - Layer 2: White potatoes. Drizzle with cream, sprinkle with cheese.
    - Repeat until all potatoes are used.
5.  **The Crown:** For the top layer, alternate colors for a beautiful visual pattern. Cover with the remaining cheese and a sprinkle of fresh thyme.
6.  **Bake:** Cover with foil. Bake at 425°F for 15 minutes.
7.  **Crisp:** Remove foil. Reduce heat to 400°F. Bake for another 45 minutes until the top is deep golden brown and the potatoes are soft when pierced with a knife.
8.  **Rest:** Let rest for 10 minutes before serving so the layers set.
