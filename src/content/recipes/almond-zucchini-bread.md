## Chef's Note

The secret to zucchini bread that isn't gummy is **The Squeeze**. Zucchini is mostly water; you must grate it and then squeeze it in a kitchen towel until it is absolutely dry before measuring. This ensures the bread stays moist from the banana and almond flour, but doesn't turn into a mushy mess.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a loaf pan with parchment paper.
2.  **The Squeeze:** Grate the zucchini. Place in a towel and squeeze vigorously until no more water comes out. Measure 1 cup of the dry shreds.
3.  **Dry:** In a large bowl, whisk the almond flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.
4.  **Wet:** In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, maple syrup, mashed banana, and coconut oil.
5.  **Mix:** Fold the wet ingredients into the dry. Stir in the zucchini shreds.
6.  **Bake:** Pour into the pan. Bake for 35-40 minutes until the top is dark golden brown and a tester comes out clean.
7.  **Rest:** Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes before lifting out via the parchment paper.
