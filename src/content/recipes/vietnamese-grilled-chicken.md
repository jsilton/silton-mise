## Chef's Note

To achieve the **Lemongrass Char** of a Vietnamese street stall, you must treat the lemongrass correctly. Finely mince only the white, tender inner core and pound it with a mortar and pestle (or the back of a knife) to release the essential oils. Thighs are mandatory here—they handle the high heat of the grill without drying out, creating those irresistible crispy, blackened edges.

## Directions

1.  **Prep Chicken:** Pound thighs to an even thickness.
2.  **Marinate:** Whisk the fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, oil, lemongrass, garlic, ginger, and chili. Toss with the chicken. Let marinate for 30 minutes (up to overnight).
3.  **Grill:** Heat grill or cast-iron skillet to medium-high. Lightly oil the grates.
4.  **Sear:** Grill chicken for 4-5 minutes per side until deeply charred and internal temp hits 160°F.
5.  **Rest:** Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before slicing. The carryover heat will take it to 165°F.
6.  **Garnish:** Top with fresh cilantro and green onions.
