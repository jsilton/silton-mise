## Chef's Note

This is the baseline for 25-minute high-performance "Fuel." The secret to zucchini noodles that aren't watery is **Textural Balance** through **The Salt-Squeeze Method**. You must toss the spiralized strands with salt and let them drain for 15 minutes _before_ sautéing; this ensures they maintain a resilient Texture and don't turn the **Avocado Pesto** into a thin soup. We use **Old Bay** as the mandatory savory-salt **High Note** to introduce a Maryland Crunch to the sweet shrimp.

## Directions

1.  **Noodles:** Spiralize zucchini. Toss with 1/2 tsp salt in a colander. Let stand for 15 minutes. Gently squeeze to remove all excess water.
2.  **Pesto:** In a food processor, pulse avocado, basil, pistachios, lemon juice, and oil until perfectly smooth and vibrant green.
3.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet, heat 1 tbsp oil. Sauté garlic for 30 seconds. Add shrimp and Old Bay. Cook for 3-4 minutes until pink and "Snappy." Remove.
4.  **Bind:** Add the dry zucchini noodles to the pan. Toss over medium-high for exactly 3 minutes until hot but still firm.
5.  **Combine:** Remove from heat. Add the avocado pesto and the cooked shrimp.
6.  **Toss:** Toss vigorously until every strand is coated in the green silk.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately.
