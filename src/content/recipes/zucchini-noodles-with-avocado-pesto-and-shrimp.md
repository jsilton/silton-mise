## Chef's Note

Zucchini noodles ("zoodles") became a low-carb pasta alternative in the 2000s. The critical step: salt the spiralized zucchini and let it drain for 15 minutes, then squeeze out the excess water. This prevents the noodles from turning the avocado pesto into a watery mess. Avocado and pistachios make a creamy, vibrant green pesto without cheese. Old Bay seasoning adds a savory, slightly spicy note that complements the sweet shrimp beautifully.

## Directions

1.  **Noodles:** Spiralize zucchini. Toss with 1/2 tsp salt in a colander. Let stand for 15 minutes. Gently squeeze to remove all excess water.
2.  **Pesto:** In a food processor, pulse avocado, basil, pistachios, lemon juice, and oil until perfectly smooth and vibrant green.
3.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet, heat 1 tbsp oil. Sauté garlic for 30 seconds. Add shrimp and Old Bay. Cook for 3-4 minutes until pink and "Snappy." Remove.
4.  **Bind:** Add the dry zucchini noodles to the pan. Toss over medium-high for exactly 3 minutes until hot but still firm.
5.  **Combine:** Remove from heat. Add the avocado pesto and the cooked shrimp.
6.  **Toss:** Toss vigorously until every strand is coated in the green silk.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately.
