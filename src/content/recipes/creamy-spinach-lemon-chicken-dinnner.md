## Chef's Note

This Mediterranean-inspired 25-minute dish sears chicken cutlets first to develop a golden crust, then removes them while building the lemon-yogurt sauce. Add spinach at the very end so it just wilts and stays vibrant green rather than overcooking into a dark clump. Fresh lemon zest brightens the creamy sauce.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Pound chicken breasts to an even 1/2-inch thickness. Season generously with salt and pepper.
2.  **Sear:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large ovenproof skillet over high heat. Sear chicken for 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown. Remove to a plate.
3.  **Aromatics:** Reduce heat to medium. Add remaining 1 tbsp oil and garlic. Sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant.
4.  **Emulsify:** Pour in the chicken broth, Greek yogurt, lemon juice, zest, and oregano. Whisk constantly until the mixture is smooth and begins to simmer.
5.  **Reduce:** Let the sauce simmer for 3 minutes to thicken slightly.
6.  **Wilt:** Fold in the spinach. Stir for 30 seconds until it just begins to collapse.
7.  **Finish:** Return the chicken breasts to the skillet. Transfer the pan to a 400°F oven for 10-12 minutes until the chicken reaches an internal temp of 165°F.
8.  **Serve:** Serve the chicken drenched in the lemon-yogurt sauce over rice or greens.
