## Chef's Note

The secret to "Cheesecake" oats that aren't a dense brick is **Structural Science** through **The Softened Emulsion Pattern**. You must whisk the cream cheese and Greek yogurt together _before_ adding the milk and oats; this creates a stable, cheesecake-like base with a sophisticated "Bounce." We use **Lemon Juice and Zest** as the mandatory **Acid Finish** to cut through the heavy cream cheese, providing the signature tang of a real cheesecake. Always add the berries just before refrigerating to maintain **Texture Integrity**.

## Directions

1.  **The Emulsion:** In a small bowl, whisk softened cream cheese, yogurt, honey, vanilla, and lemon juice until perfectly smooth.
2.  **Combine:** Stir in the milk and chia seeds.
3.  **The Grain:** Add the rolled oats. Stir vigorously until the oats are fully submerged.
4.  **Fold:** Gently stir in the chopped strawberries and lemon zest.
5.  **The Set:** Transfer to a wide-mouth glass jar. Cover and **refrigerate for at least 4 hours** (overnight is best) to allow the chia and oats to hydrate.
6.  **Serve:** Stir once more. Garnish with a fresh strawberry and a "High Note" crack of black pepper (trust me).
