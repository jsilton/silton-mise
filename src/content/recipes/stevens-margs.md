## Chef's Note

This is the definitive "Speed" cocktail for the Silton home bar. The secret to its Success is **The Smoked Salt Pulse**. Instead of rimming the glass (which provides inconsistent flavor), we add a tiny pinch of **Smoked Sea Salt** directly into the shaker. This introduces a "Deep Note" that amplifies the wood-aged notes of the reposado tequila. We use a **1:1:1 ratio** of tequila, orange liqueur, and lime to ensure a perfect balance where the acid provides a sharp "Snap" against the velvety agave "Bounce."

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Fill a rocks glass with fresh ice and let it chill while you mix the drink.
2.  **The Base:** In a cocktail shaker filled with large ice cubes, combine the tequila, Cointreau, lime juice, and agave.
3.  **The Pulse:** Add the pinch of smoked sea salt.
4.  **Aeration:** Shake vigorously for 15-20 seconds until the shaker is ice-cold and frosted.
5.  **Strain:** Double strain into the prepared rocks glass over fresh ice.
6.  **Garnish:** Express a lime wedge over the surface and drop it in for the final aromatic **High Note**.
