## Chef's Note

This modern margarita uses a 1:1:1 ratio of reposado tequila, Cointreau, and fresh lime juice for balanced sweet-tart-boozy proportions. Instead of rimming the glass, a pinch of smoked sea salt added directly to the shaker amplifies the wood-aged notes of the reposado while providing consistent seasoning throughout the drink.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Fill a rocks glass with fresh ice and let it chill while you mix the drink.
2.  **The Base:** In a cocktail shaker filled with large ice cubes, combine the tequila, Cointreau, lime juice, and agave.
3.  **The Pulse:** Add the pinch of smoked sea salt.
4.  **Aeration:** Shake vigorously for 15-20 seconds until the shaker is ice-cold and frosted.
5.  **Strain:** Double strain into the prepared rocks glass over fresh ice.
6.  **Garnish:** Express a lime wedge over the surface and drop it in for the final aromatic **High Note**.
