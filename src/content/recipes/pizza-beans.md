## Description

Think deep-dish pizza, but swap the dough for creamy white beans and greens. It's cheesy, tomato-y, and incredibly satisfying without the meat.

## Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 450°F.
2.  Heat oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion until soft (8 mins). Add garlic and red pepper flakes for 1 minute.
3.  Add the kale and cook until wilted.
4.  Pour in the crushed tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Stir in the beans and oregano. Season with salt and pepper.
5.  Top generously with mozzarella and Parmesan.
6.  Bake for 15-20 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and browned.
