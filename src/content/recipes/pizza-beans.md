## Chef's Note

This Tex-Mex inspired skillet dish swaps pizza dough for protein-rich white beans, creating a comfort food that's lighter but equally satisfying. Cooking kale just until wilted preserves a slight bite that contrasts with the creamy beans and melted cheese. Giant butter beans or gigante beans work best for their substantial, meaty texture.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 450°F.
2.  **Base:** Heat oil in an oven-safe heavy skillet (cast iron is best). Sauté the onion until soft (8 mins). Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.
3.  **Greens:** Add the kale to the pan and stir until it just turns bright green and collapses.
4.  **Simmer:** Stir in the tomatoes, beans, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper. Let it simmer for 5 minutes to marry the flavors.
5.  **Assemble:** Top with mozzarella and Parmesan.
6.  **Bake:** Transfer the skillet to the oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes until the cheese is bubbling and has golden brown spots.
7.  **Serve:** Let rest for 5 minutes. Scoop into bowls and serve with crusty bread.
