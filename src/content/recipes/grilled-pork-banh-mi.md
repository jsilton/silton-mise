## Chef's Note

A great Banh Mi is an exercise in **Structural Contrast**. You need the "Shure" crunch of the bread, the fatty char of the pork, and the ice-cold acid of the pickles. We use **Lemongrass** in the marinade to provide that unmistakable floral aroma. The secret to the bread: if it's too tough, hollow out some of the crumb to make room for more fillings.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** Whisk fish sauce, sugar, honey, garlic, and lemongrass. Toss with the pork. Let marinate for at least 2 hours (ideally overnight).
2.  **Pickles:** Prepare your [quick Pickled Carrots and Daikon](/silton-mise/recipes/quick-pickled-carrots-and-daikon) at least 30 minutes in advance.
3.  **Grill:** Thread pork onto skewers or use a grill basket. Grill over high heat for 3-4 minutes per side until charred and just cooked through.
4.  **Assemble:** Split the baguettes. Spread a generous layer of mayo. Drizzle with a few drops of Maggi or Soy.
5.  **Fill:** Layer the grilled pork, cucumber spears, [quick Pickled Carrots and Daikon](/silton-mise/recipes/quick-pickled-carrots-and-daikon), and fresh cilantro. Top with jalapeños for heat.
