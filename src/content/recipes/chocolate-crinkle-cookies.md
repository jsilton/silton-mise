## Chef's Note

The crinkle cookie is all about the **Textural Balance** of the "shackle"—the crackly, snowy crust. The secret to the Kitchen Standard is the **Double-Sugar Roll**: we roll the dough balls in granulated sugar first, then in powdered sugar. The granulated sugar acts as a structural barrier that prevents the powdered sugar from being absorbed into the dough during baking, resulting in a high-contrast Crunch and a snowy-white finish. Chilling the dough for the full 2 hours is mandatory for the "Bounce."

## Directions

1.  **Melt:** Set a heatproof bowl over simmering water. Melt the chopped chocolate and butter together until smooth. Let cool slightly.
2.  **Dry Mix:** Whisk flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until no lumps remain.
3.  **Aeration:** In a large bowl, beat the brown sugar, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla on medium-high for 3 minutes until pale and frothy.
4.  **Combine:** Fold the chocolate-butter mixture into the eggs. On low speed, add the dry mix until **just combined**.
5.  **The Chill:** Cover and refrigerate for **at least 2 hours** until firm.
6.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment. Place 1 cup granulated sugar in one bowl and 1 cup powdered sugar in another.
7.  **The Double Roll:** Scoop 1-tbsp portions of dough. Roll into a ball. Roll in granulated sugar, then immediately in powdered sugar.
8.  **Bake:** Arrange 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes until the tops are cracked and the edges feel firm.
9.  **Cool:** Let cool on the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a rack.
