## Chef's Note

Ground turkey breast is notoriously dry since it's so lean. The trick is making a panade: soak the panko breadcrumbs in milk for 5 minutes before mixing with the meat. This creates a moisture reservoir that keeps the meatballs tender even when fully cooked. Baking at high heat gives you a nice crust without the mess of frying, and the hoisin-soy glaze adds sweet-savory flavor with a glossy finish.

## Directions

1.  **The Panade:** In a large bowl, mix the panko and milk. Let sit for 5 minutes.
2.  **The Mix:** Add the turkey, eggs, garlic, scallions, ginger, and salt to the panade. Mix with your hands until just combined—**do not overwork.**
3.  **Shape:** Form into 24 equal-sized meatballs (about 1.5 oz each).
4.  **Bake:** Arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake at 400°F for 15-18 minutes until golden and the internal temp is 160°F.
5.  **The Glaze:** While meatballs bake, whisk the glaze ingredients in a large skillet. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sauce is thick and glossy.
6.  **Toss:** Add the hot meatballs to the skillet. Toss until every meatball is lacquered in the sauce.
7.  **Finish:** Garnish with sesame seeds and extra scallion greens.
