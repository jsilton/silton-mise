## Chef's Note

Ground turkey breast is notoriously dry. We fix this by applying the **Executive Panade Method**: soaking the panko in milk before mixing it into the meat creates a moisture reservoir that prevents the meatballs from turning into hockey pucks. We bake them at high heat to get a "sear" without frying, then toss them in a glossy, acid-balanced hoisin glaze.

## Directions

1.  **The Panade:** In a large bowl, mix the panko and milk. Let sit for 5 minutes.
2.  **The Mix:** Add the turkey, eggs, garlic, scallions, ginger, and salt to the panade. Mix with your hands until just combined—**do not overwork.**
3.  **Shape:** Form into 24 equal-sized meatballs (about 1.5 oz each).
4.  **Bake:** Arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake at 400°F for 15-18 minutes until golden and the internal temp is 160°F.
5.  **The Glaze:** While meatballs bake, whisk the glaze ingredients in a large skillet. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sauce is thick and glossy.
6.  **Toss:** Add the hot meatballs to the skillet. Toss until every meatball is lacquered in the sauce.
7.  **Finish:** Garnish with sesame seeds and extra scallion greens.
