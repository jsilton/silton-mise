## Chef's Note

Frozen mango and fresh avocado blend together into a thick, creamy smoothie that masks spinach's leafy texture. The avocado provides healthy fats and silkiness, while oats add complex carbohydrates for sustained energy. Vanilla extract creates milkshake-like aroma that makes this green smoothie appealing to young palates.

## Directions

1.  **The Stack:** In a high-speed blender, add ingredients in this exact order: milk, oats, spinach, banana, avocado, and finally the frozen mango. Placing the greens at the bottom ensures they are completely pulverized first.
2.  **Process:** Blend on low, then quickly increase to high speed. Process for 60 seconds until the mixture is a vibrant, uniform green with no visible leaf flecks.
3.  **Adjust:** If the smoothie is too thick, add a splash more milk. If you need more "High Note" sweetness, add 1 tsp of maple syrup and pulse again.
4.  **Serve:** Serve immediately in a chilled glass with a wide straw.
