## Chef's Note

Lean turkey needs moisture - finely minced carrots release liquid as they bake, keeping meatballs juicy from within. Mince carrots almost to a paste so they integrate seamlessly. Two-tablespoon portions cook quickly at 350°F without drying out.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
2.  **Mince:** Use a food processor or sharp knife to finely mince the carrots and onions until they are almost a paste—this ensures they integrate perfectly into the meat.
3.  **Combine:** In a large bowl, combine turkey, breadcrumbs, minced veg, eggs, and seasonings. Use your hands to mix **gently** until just incorporated. Do not over-mix, or the meatballs will become tough.
4.  **Shape:** Form the mixture into 2-tablespoon-sized balls (about the size of a golf ball). Arrange on the prepared baking sheet.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 25-30 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 165°F and there is no pink in the center.
6.  **Serve:** Serve hot with your favorite tomato sauce or over spaghetti squash.
