## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Finely mince carrot and onion by hand or in a food processor and then combine all ingredients. Use your hands to gently mix.
2. Shape meatballs into 2-tablespoon-sized-balls and place on a baking sheet covered in parchment paper.
3. Bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees, checking at 30 minutes to ensure there is no pink in the middle of the meatballs. Cook for 5 more minutes if needed.
4. Serve with pasta or spaghetti squash, and your favorite tomato sauce. You can veg it up by adding sautéed onion, zucchini, red pepper, and grape tomatoes.
5. You can freeze the meatballs in a plastic bag in the freezer for up to 3 months, letting them defrost in the fridge or microwave before eating.
