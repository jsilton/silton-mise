## Chef's Note

This Thai-inspired coconut curry sears shrimp in butter first, then removes them before building the sauce to prevent overcooking. Zucchini added at the very end stays crisp and bright green, providing textural contrast to the silky, honey-sweetened coconut sauce. Fresh basil finishes the dish with aromatic lift.

## Directions

1.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook for 2-3 minutes total, turning once, until pink and just opaque. Remove to a plate.
2.  **Aromatics:** In the same pan, add onions, garlic, and mushrooms. Sauté for 3 minutes. Sprinkle the curry powder over the vegetables and stir for 1 minute to "bloom" the spices.
3.  **The Glaze:** Pour in the coconut milk. Add honey and lime juice. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to medium-low.
4.  **Veg:** Add the zucchini slices. Simmer for 3 minutes until just tender but still bright.
5.  **Combine:** Return the shrimp and any plate juices to the pan. Toss to coat and simmer for 1 minute.
6.  **Finish:** Stir in the fresh basil. Taste and adjust with salt or extra honey. Serve immediately over rice.
