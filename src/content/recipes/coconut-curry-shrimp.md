## Chef's Note
This is a 25-minute "Speed" masterclass. The secret to the Silton Standard here is the **Shrimp Snap Pattern**: we sear the shrimp in butter first and remove them *before* building the sauce. This ensures they don't overcook into rubbery curls while the sauce simmers. We maintain **Texture Integrity** by adding the zucchini only at the very end—it should be "Snappy" and bright green, providing a textural contrast to the silky, honey-sweetened coconut glaze.

## Directions

1.  **The Snap:** In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook for 2-3 minutes total, turning once, until pink and just opaque. Remove to a plate.
2.  **Aromatics:** In the same pan, add onions, garlic, and mushrooms. Sauté for 3 minutes. Sprinkle the curry powder over the vegetables and stir for 1 minute to "bloom" the spices.
3.  **The Glaze:** Pour in the coconut milk. Add honey and lime juice. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to medium-low.
4.  **Veg:** Add the zucchini slices. Simmer for 3 minutes until just tender but still bright.
5.  **Combine:** Return the shrimp and any plate juices to the pan. Toss to coat and simmer for 1 minute.
6.  **Finish:** Stir in the fresh basil. Taste and adjust with salt or extra honey. Serve immediately over rice.
