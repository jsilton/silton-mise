## Chef's Note

The secret to "Restaurant Quality" cornbread is the **Preheated Skillet**. By getting your cast iron skillet screaming hot in the oven before pouring in the batter, you "fry" the bottom and sides instantly, resulting in a dark, buttery, crunchy crust that a standard baking dish cannot achieve.

## Directions

1.  **Preheat:** Place a 9-inch cast iron skillet in the oven and preheat to 425°F.
2.  **Dry:** Whisk the cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and soda in a large bowl.
3.  **Wet:** In another bowl, whisk buttermilk, eggs, and 7 tbsp of the melted butter.
4.  **Mix:** Fold wet into dry until just combined.
5.  **The Sear:** Carefully remove the hot skillet. Add the remaining 1 tbsp of butter—it should sizzle and melt instantly. Swirl to coat the sides.
6.  **Bake:** Pour the batter into the hot skillet (it should crackle!). Reduce oven to 375°F. Bake for 20-22 minutes until the center is firm and the edges are deep brown.
7.  **Serve:** Slice directly in the skillet and serve with honey butter.
