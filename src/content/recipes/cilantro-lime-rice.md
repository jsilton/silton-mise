## Chef's Note

This Mexican-style rice is a staple for tacos, burrito bowls, and grain bowls. The key is adding cilantro and lime juice after cooking—never during—to preserve the herbs' vibrant green color and the lime's bright, acidic punch. Folding them into hot steamed rice gently releases their aromatics without cooking them.

## Directions

1.  **Rinse:** Rinse the jasmine rice in a bowl until the water runs clear.
2.  **Boil:** Combine rice, water/broth, and salt in a pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes.
3.  **Steam:** Turn off the heat. **Keep the lid on** and let the rice steam for 10 minutes.
4.  **Fold:** Remove the lid. Add the butter, lime juice, lime zest, and cilantro. Gently fluff and fold with a fork until well combined.
