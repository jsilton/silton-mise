## Chef's Note

This is the essential base for tacos, bowls, and shrimp. The secret is to **Fold at the End**: never boil the cilantro or lime juice with the rice, as it will turn the herbs gray and the juice bitter. By folding them into the hot, steamed rice at the very end, you preserve the vibrant color and the sharp, acidic punch of the lime.

## Directions

1.  **Rinse:** Rinse the jasmine rice in a bowl until the water runs clear.
2.  **Boil:** Combine rice, water/broth, and salt in a pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes.
3.  **Steam:** Turn off the heat. **Keep the lid on** and let the rice steam for 10 minutes.
4.  **Fold:** Remove the lid. Add the butter, lime juice, lime zest, and cilantro. Gently fluff and fold with a fork until well combined.
