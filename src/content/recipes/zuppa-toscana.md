## Chef's Note

Zuppa Toscana ("Tuscan soup") became famous in America through Olive Garden in the 1990s, though similar soups with sausage, potatoes, and greens have been made in Tuscany for generations. Russet potatoes naturally thicken the broth as they simmer—their starch helps emulsify the coconut milk into a creamy consistency without heavy cream. Add the kale in the final minute to keep it bright green and slightly crisp against the rich sausage.

## Directions

1.  **The Render:** In a large Dutch oven, brown the sausage over medium heat for 8 minutes, breaking it into small crumbles. Remove sausage to a plate, leaving the fat in the pot.
2.  **Foundation:** In the sausage fat, sauté onion and garlic for 5 minutes until soft. Stir in the red pepper flakes.
3.  **Simmer:** Add the potatoes and bone broth. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10-12 minutes until potatoes are soft.
4.  **Emulsify:** Pour in the coconut milk and return the sausage to the pot. Stir for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to bridge.
5.  **Wilt:** Stir in the fresh kale. Cook for exactly 1 minute until just collapsed.
6.  **Serve:** Ladle into deep bowls. Top with a final crack of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil for the mandatory **High Note**.
