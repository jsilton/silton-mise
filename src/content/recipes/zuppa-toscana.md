## Chef's Note
The secret to an elite Zuppa Toscana without heavy cream is **Structural Science** through **The Potato-Starch Pattern**. We simmer cubed Russet potatoes in bone broth until they are "fork-tender"; as the starch granules release, they naturally emulsify with the full-fat **Coconut Milk** to create a rich, velvety "Bounce." We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The Late-Kale Wilt**: we add the kale during the final 60 seconds of cooking—this ensures the leaves are bright green and maintain their "Snap" against the smoky sausage.

## Directions

1.  **The Render:** In a large Dutch oven, brown the sausage over medium heat for 8 minutes, breaking it into small crumbles. Remove sausage to a plate, leaving the fat in the pot.
2.  **Foundation:** In the sausage fat, sauté onion and garlic for 5 minutes until soft. Stir in the red pepper flakes.
3.  **Simmer:** Add the potatoes and bone broth. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10-12 minutes until potatoes are soft.
4.  **Emulsify:** Pour in the coconut milk and return the sausage to the pot. Stir for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to bridge.
5.  **Wilt:** Stir in the fresh kale. Cook for exactly 1 minute until just collapsed.
6.  **Serve:** Ladle into deep bowls. Top with a final crack of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil for the mandatory **High Note**.
