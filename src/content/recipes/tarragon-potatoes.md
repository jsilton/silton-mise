## Chef's Note
The secret to "Gold Standard" tarragon potatoes is **Texture Integrity** through **The Butter-Finish Pattern**. Tarragon has a powerful, anise-like "Deep Note" that can become bitter if burned; we toss the potatoes in oil and herbs first, then add cold butter cubes to the pan halfway through roasting. This creates a foaming emulsion that bastes the potatoes, ensuring a rich "Bounce" inside a "Snappy" golden crust. Be precise with the tarragon—it provides a sharp **Acid Finish** that defines the dish.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking dish with parchment.
2.  **Toss:** Combine potato cubes, olive oil, salt, pepper, and tarragon in a large bowl. Toss vigorously until every chunk is heavily coated.
3.  **Roast:** Arrange in a **single layer** (The Single-Layer Guard). Bake for 25 minutes.
4.  **The Sizzle:** Remove pan. Add the cold butter cubes to the dish and toss the potatoes to coat in the melting fat.
5.  **Finish:** Return to oven. Bake for 20 more minutes, tossing once, until the potatoes are deep golden brown and the edges are crispy.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately while the herb aroma is at its peak.
