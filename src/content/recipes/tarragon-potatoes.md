## Directions

1. Cut potatoes into 1-1.5 inch cubes (do not peel).
2. Arrange in a rose single layer in baking dish and add enough olive oil to coat. I also add a tablespoon or two of butter just because. Sprinkle with tarragon.
3. Important note: tarragon can get surprising “hot” and spicy if used in excess, be careful.
4. Bake for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees, turning potatoes once about half way through and again with about 5 minutes to go.
