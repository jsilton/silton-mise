## Chef's Note

This classic Cantonese preparation balances the delicate leaves and firmer stems of bok choy by searing the garlic and white stems first to develop color, then adding water and covering to flash-steam the leaves in under 2 minutes. Oyster sauce provides the traditional glossy, umami-rich finish.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Wash the bok choy thoroughly between the stalks to remove grit.
2.  **Infuse:** Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat with the neutral oil. Add the garlic slices and sauté for 30 seconds until pale gold.
3.  **Sear:** Add the bok choy to the pan, cut-side down. Let them sear for 1-2 minutes until the white parts have a few golden spots.
4.  **Steam:** Add 2 tbsp water or broth. Immediately cover with a tight lid. Steam for 60-90 seconds. The leaves should be wilted and the stems tender-crisp.
5.  **Finish:** Remove lid. Drizzle the oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sesame oil over the top. Toss gently to coat.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately, topped with extra fried garlic if desired.
