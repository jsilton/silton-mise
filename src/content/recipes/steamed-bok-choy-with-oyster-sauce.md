## Chef's Note

The secret to great bok choy is protecting the leaves while softening the stems. We use a **Two-Stage Sauté-Steam**: searing the garlic and the white stems first to get a little color, then adding a splash of water and covering the pan to "flash steam" the green leaves in seconds. This ensures the stems are snappy and the leaves are vibrant green, never mushy.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Wash the bok choy thoroughly between the stalks to remove grit.
2.  **Infuse:** Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat with the neutral oil. Add the garlic slices and sauté for 30 seconds until pale gold.
3.  **Sear:** Add the bok choy to the pan, cut-side down. Let them sear for 1-2 minutes until the white parts have a few golden spots.
4.  **Steam:** Add 2 tbsp water or broth. Immediately cover with a tight lid. Steam for 60-90 seconds. The leaves should be wilted and the stems tender-crisp.
5.  **Finish:** Remove lid. Drizzle the oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sesame oil over the top. Toss gently to coat.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately, topped with extra fried garlic if desired.
