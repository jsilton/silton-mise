## Chef's Note

Pai huang gua (smashed cucumber salad) is a northern Chinese classic where cucumbers are literally smacked with a knife blade to create irregular, jagged surfaces that trap dressing better than clean slices. Salting the smashed chunks for 30 minutes draws out moisture, keeping them crisp and preventing the dressing from becoming watery.

## Directions

1.  **Smash:** Place cucumbers on a cutting board. Lay the flat side of a chef's knife over them and smack the blade firmly with your palm until the cucumber splits open. Slice diagonally into bite-sized chunks.
2.  **Drain:** Place chunks in a colander set over a bowl. Toss with the salt and sugar. Let sit for 30 minutes in the fridge to draw out excess water. (Do not skip this, or your salad will be watery).
3.  **Dress:** Whisk together vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, and chili crisp.
4.  **Toss:** Drain the liquid from the cucumbers (shake them well). Toss with the dressing.
5.  **Serve:** Top with sesame seeds. Serve immediately or marinate for up to 4 hours.
