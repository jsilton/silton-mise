## Description

A Din Tai Fung-inspired side. Smashing the cucumbers creates jagged edges that soak up the dressing better than clean slices. Salting them first ensures they stay crunchy for days.

## Directions

1.  **Smash:** Place cucumbers on a cutting board. Lay the flat side of a chef's knife over them and smack the blade firmly with your palm until the cucumber splits open. Slice diagonally into bite-sized chunks.
2.  **Drain:** Place chunks in a colander set over a bowl. Toss with the salt and sugar. Let sit for 30 minutes in the fridge to draw out excess water. (Do not skip this, or your salad will be watery).
3.  **Dress:** Whisk together vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, and chili crisp.
4.  **Toss:** Drain the liquid from the cucumbers (shake them well). Toss with the dressing.
5.  **Serve:** Top with sesame seeds. Serve immediately or marinate for up to 4 hours.
