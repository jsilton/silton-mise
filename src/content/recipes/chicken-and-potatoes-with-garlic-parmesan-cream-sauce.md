## Chef's Note

The secret to this dish is **Staged Cooking**. If you cook the potatoes in the cream sauce, they will be mushy and the skin will be flabby. We **Roast** the potatoes at high heat (425°F) separately to get a golden crust, while searing the chicken to render the fat. We only combine them with the velvety Parmesan cream at the very end to preserve the individual textures.

## Directions

1.  **Roast Potatoes:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss potatoes with oil and salt. Roast on a sheet pan for 20-25 minutes until crispy.
2.  **Sear Chicken:** Season chicken with Italian seasoning. In a large oven-safe skillet, sear chicken skin-side down for 5-7 minutes until the skin is deep golden and crispy. Flip and sear for 2 minutes. Remove to a plate.
3.  **The Sauce:** Wipe out excess fat. Melt butter in the skillet. Add garlic for 30 seconds. Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute (The Roux).
4.  **Emulsify:** Gradually whisk in broth and cream until thickened. Stir in the Parmesan and spinach until wilted.
5.  **Combine:** Return the chicken and the **crispy roasted potatoes** to the skillet.
6.  **Finish:** Transfer the skillet to the oven for 10 minutes to finish cooking the chicken (165°F). Serve immediately.
