## Chef's Note

This is a modern Italian-American one-pan meal inspired by the classic combination of roasted chicken, crispy potatoes, and creamy Parmesan sauce. The technique is similar to French coq au vin but simplified for weeknight cooking. The key is roasting the potatoes separately at high heat (425°F) first to get them golden and crispy - if you cook them directly in the cream sauce, they'll turn mushy and the skins will be flabby. Sear the chicken skin-side down to render the fat and crisp the skin, then combine everything in the cream at the end.

## Directions

1.  **Roast Potatoes:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss potatoes with oil and salt. Roast on a sheet pan for 20-25 minutes until crispy.
2.  **Sear Chicken:** Season chicken with Italian seasoning. In a large oven-safe skillet, sear chicken skin-side down for 5-7 minutes until the skin is deep golden and crispy. Flip and sear for 2 minutes. Remove to a plate.
3.  **The Sauce:** Wipe out excess fat. Melt butter in the skillet. Add garlic for 30 seconds. Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute (The Roux).
4.  **Emulsify:** Gradually whisk in broth and cream until thickened. Stir in the Parmesan and spinach until wilted.
5.  **Combine:** Return the chicken and the **crispy roasted potatoes** to the skillet.
6.  **Finish:** Transfer the skillet to the oven for 10 minutes to finish cooking the chicken (165°F). Serve immediately.
