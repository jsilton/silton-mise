## Chef's Note

This is a "Fuel" staple that relies on **Emulsion**. By processing the oats into a fine flour in a blender, we avoid the gritty texture of whole oats. The Greek yogurt provides the moisture and protein that allows us to reduce the added fat. This is the **Silton Standard** for healthy, kid-friendly snacks.

## Directions

1.  **Blender:** Place the oats, bananas, yogurt, eggs, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda in a blender or food processor. Process on high for 1 minute until smooth and creamy.
2.  **Fold:** Stir in the chocolate chips by hand.
3.  **Portion:** Pour into a greased or lined 12-cup muffin tin, filling 3/4 full.
4.  **Bake:** Bake at 400°F for 15-18 minutes until the tops are golden and springy to the touch.
5.  **Cool:** Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes.
