## Chef's Note

Blending rolled oats into flour creates smooth muffins without grittiness. Greek yogurt provides moisture and protein while reducing the need for added fat. These muffins freeze well for up to 3 months and reheat beautifully for quick breakfasts.

## Directions

1.  **Blender:** Place the oats, bananas, yogurt, eggs, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda in a blender or food processor. Process on high for 1 minute until smooth and creamy.
2.  **Fold:** Stir in the chocolate chips by hand.
3.  **Portion:** Pour into a greased or lined 12-cup muffin tin, filling 3/4 full.
4.  **Bake:** Bake at 400°F for 15-18 minutes until the tops are golden and springy to the touch.
5.  **Cool:** Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes.
