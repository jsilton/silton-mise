## Chef's Note
This is a **Modern Heritage** update to a classic potluck staple. To ensure **Texture Integrity**, we use the **Double Corn Pattern**: combining creamed corn for moisture with whole kernels for "Snap." The secret to the Silton Standard is the **Butter Emulsion**: we whisk the melted butter into the sour cream and eggs before adding the dry mix, resulting in a rich, pudding-like "Bounce" that never turns dry or cakey.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9x13 or 2-quart baking dish.
2.  **Wet Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter, eggs, and sour cream until smooth.
3.  **The Corn:** Stir in the cream-style corn and the drained whole kernel corn. If you want a "High Note" kick, fold in the diced green chiles now.
4.  **Fold:** Sprinkle the corn bread mix over the wet ingredients. Fold gently until **just combined**—do not over-mix.
5.  **Bake:** Pour the batter into the prepared dish. If using cheese, sprinkle it over the top now.
6.  **Finish:** Bake for 35-45 minutes until the center is set and the edges are golden brown. Let sit for 5 minutes before serving to allow the internal structure to firm up.
