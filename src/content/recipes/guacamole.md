## Chef's Note

The secret to "Gold Standard" guacamole is **Structural Science** through **The Lime Guard Pattern**. You must toss the avocado chunks in the lime juice _before_ mashing; this ensures every molecule of fat is coated in acid, which inhibits oxidation and keeps the guacamole a vibrant, electric green for hours. We use **The 1-Hour Set**: letting the guacamole rest at room temperature allows the garlic and cumin to bloom into the healthy fats, resulting in a much deeper flavor than eating it immediately.

## Directions

1.  **The Guard:** Scoop the avocado pulp into a large bowl. Add the lime juice and toss until every piece is glossy and coated.
2.  **The Mash:** Using a potato masher or a large fork, mash the avocados until they reach your desired consistency (the Silton Standard is slightly chunky for **Texture Integrity**).
3.  **Season:** Fold in the salt, cumin, and cayenne.
4.  **Add Snap:** Gently fold in the onions, tomatoes, jalapeño, garlic, and cilantro.
5.  **The Set:** Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap pressed directly onto the surface of the guacamole. **Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour** before serving.
6.  **Serve:** Stir once and serve with high-quality corn chips.
