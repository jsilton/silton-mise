## Chef's Note

Traditional Mexican guacamole keeps avocados bright green by tossing chunks in lime juice before mashing, ensuring every surface is coated with acid to prevent oxidation. Letting the guacamole rest at room temperature for an hour allows the garlic and cumin to bloom into the avocado's fats, developing deeper flavor than serving immediately.

## Directions

1.  **The Guard:** Scoop the avocado pulp into a large bowl. Add the lime juice and toss until every piece is glossy and coated.
2.  **The Mash:** Using a potato masher or a large fork, mash the avocados until they reach your desired consistency (the Kitchen Standard is slightly chunky for **Textural Balance**).
3.  **Season:** Fold in the salt, cumin, and cayenne.
4.  **Add Snap:** Gently fold in the onions, tomatoes, jalapeño, garlic, and cilantro.
5.  **The Finish:** Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap pressed directly onto the surface of the guacamole. **Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour** before serving.
6.  **Serve:** Stir once and serve with high-quality corn chips.
