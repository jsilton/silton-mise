## Chef's Note

This is a **Updated Classic** masterpiece that replaces the greasy deep-fry with a superior high-heat bake. We use two specific Culinary Methods: **Enzyme Tenderization** (the buttermilk soak) to break down proteins for maximum juiciness, and the **Wire Rack Hack**. By elevating the chicken on a rack, we allow hot air to circulate 360 degrees, ensuring the **Cornflake Crust** stays shatteringly crisp on the bottom. Never skip the Parmesan in the breading—it provides the "Salty Snap" that defines this dish.

## Directions

1.  **The Soak:** In a large bowl, whisk buttermilk, hot sauce, lemon juice, onion, garlic, and thyme. Add chicken pieces and submerge. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours (12 hours is the Kitchen Standard).
2.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Fit a large sheet pan with a wire cooling rack and spray with oil.
3.  **The Breading:** In a shallow dish, combine crushed corn flakes, Parmesan, and fresh thyme. Season with salt and pepper.
4.  **Dredge:** Remove chicken from the marinade, letting excess drip off. Press firmly into the cornflake mixture until fully coated on all sides.
5.  **Bake:** Arrange on the wire rack. Spray the tops of the chicken lightly with oil spray. Bake for 45 minutes until the crust is deep golden brown and the internal temp is 165°F.
6.  **Rest:** Let rest for 5 minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute.
