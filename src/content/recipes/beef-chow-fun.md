## Chef's Note

Beef Chow Fun is the ultimate test of a Cantonese chef. It requires **Structural Science**: the beef must be "velveted" with baking soda to remain tender, and the noodles must be treated gently. The secret is high heat and **minimal stirring**—you want the noodles to sear and char (Wok Hei) without breaking into small pieces.

## Directions

1.  **Velvet:** Toss the sliced beef with the soy sauce, wine, cornstarch, and baking soda. Let sit for 20 minutes.
2.  **Noodles:** If using fresh noodles from a bag, microwave them for 30 seconds to loosen them up so you can separate them without breaking.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat a wok over high heat until smoking. Add oil and sear the beef in a single layer until browned and charred. Remove to a plate.
4.  **Aromatics:** Add another splash of oil. Sauté ginger and scallions for 30 seconds.
5.  **The Noodles:** Add the noodles to the wok. Let them sit undisturbed for 1 minute to get some color.
6.  **Toss:** Add the seared beef and the whisked sauce ingredients. Use a wide spatula to gently "fold" the noodles from the bottom up.
7.  **Finish:** Add the bean sprouts. Toss for 30 seconds until just wilted. Serve immediately.
