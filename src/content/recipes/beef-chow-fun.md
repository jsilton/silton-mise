## Chef's Note

Beef chow fun is a classic Cantonese stir-fry from Guangzhou, famous for showcasing wok hei—the smoky, charred flavor from high-heat cooking. Marinating the beef with baking soda tenderizes it (a technique called "velveting" in Chinese cooking). The key is using very high heat and stirring minimally—let the noodles sit undisturbed so they char and develop flavor without breaking apart. Fresh wide rice noodles (ho fun) are essential for the authentic chewy texture.

## Directions

1.  **Velvet:** Toss the sliced beef with the soy sauce, wine, cornstarch, and baking soda. Let sit for 20 minutes.
2.  **Noodles:** If using fresh noodles from a bag, microwave them for 30 seconds to loosen them up so you can separate them without breaking.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat a wok over high heat until smoking. Add oil and sear the beef in a single layer until browned and charred. Remove to a plate.
4.  **Aromatics:** Add another splash of oil. Sauté ginger and scallions for 30 seconds.
5.  **The Noodles:** Add the noodles to the wok. Let them sit undisturbed for 1 minute to get some color.
6.  **Toss:** Add the seared beef and the whisked sauce ingredients. Use a wide spatula to gently "fold" the noodles from the bottom up.
7.  **Finish:** Add the bean sprouts. Toss for 30 seconds until just wilted. Serve immediately.
