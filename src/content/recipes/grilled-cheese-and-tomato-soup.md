## Chef's Note

This is the baseline for Executive comfort. The secret to the sandwich is **Culinary Technique** through **The Mayo Crust Method**: we use mayonnaise instead of butter on the exterior of the bread. Mayo has a higher smoke point and creates a perfectly uniform, golden Crunch that butter alone can't achieve. For the soup, we use **Updated Classic**: instead of a thin watery broth, we simmer San Marzano tomatoes with heavy cream and then emulsify until velvety. The avocado provides the Texture inside the sandwich to contrast the sharp cheese.

## Directions

1.  **The Soup:** In a medium pot, sauté onion and garlic in 1 tbsp butter until soft. Add tomatoes, broth, and basil. Simmer for 15 minutes.
2.  **The Emulsion:** Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth. Stir in the heavy cream and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm on low.
3.  **The Sandwich:** Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on one side of each slice of bread.
4.  **Assemble:** Place two slices, mayo-side down, in a cool skillet. Layer with cheese and avocado slices. Top with the remaining bread, mayo-side up.
5.  **The Sear:** Turn heat to medium. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side, pressing down lightly with a spatula, until the bread is deep golden brown and the cheese is fully melted.
6.  **Serve:** Slice the sandwiches on a diagonal and serve immediately with a deep bowl of the hot tomato soup for dipping.
