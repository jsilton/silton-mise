## Chef's Note

Mayonnaise on the bread's exterior creates a more evenly golden crust than butter—mayo's higher smoke point prevents burning and delivers uniform browning. For the soup, simmering San Marzano tomatoes with heavy cream before blending creates a velvety texture far superior to thin, watery versions. Sliced avocado inside the sandwich provides creamy contrast to sharp cheese.

## Directions

1.  **The Soup:** In a medium pot, sauté onion and garlic in 1 tbsp butter until soft. Add tomatoes, broth, and basil. Simmer for 15 minutes.
2.  **The Emulsion:** Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth. Stir in the heavy cream and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm on low.
3.  **The Sandwich:** Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on one side of each slice of bread.
4.  **Assemble:** Place two slices, mayo-side down, in a cool skillet. Layer with cheese and avocado slices. Top with the remaining bread, mayo-side up.
5.  **The Sear:** Turn heat to medium. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side, pressing down lightly with a spatula, until the bread is deep golden brown and the cheese is fully melted.
6.  **Serve:** Slice the sandwiches on a diagonal and serve immediately with a deep bowl of the hot tomato soup for dipping.
