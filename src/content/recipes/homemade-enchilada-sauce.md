## Chef's Note

This is our baseline **Modularity** component for all Mexican-inspired dishes. The secret to a professional-grade sauce is **The Spice Bloom Method**: we whisk the chili powder and cumin directly into the hot oil and flour (the roux) _before_ adding the broth. This toasts the spices and releases their fat-soluble aromatic oils, resulting in a deeper flavor than store-bought jars. The **Apple Cider Vinegar** is the mandatory **Acid Balance** that cuts through the earthy cumin and brightens the tomato paste.

## Directions

1.  **The Roux:** In a medium saucepan, heat oil over medium. Whisk in the flour and all the spices (The Bloom). Cook, whisking constantly, for 1 minute until fragrant and the color deepens.
2.  **Emulsify:** Whisk in the tomato paste until smooth.
3.  **The Liquid:** Slowly pour in the broth while whisking vigorously to remove all lumps.
4.  **Simmer:** Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5-7 minutes until the sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon.
5.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Whisk in the vinegar and black pepper. Taste and add more salt if needed.
6.  **Store:** Use immediately or store in a glass jar in the fridge for up to 1 week.
