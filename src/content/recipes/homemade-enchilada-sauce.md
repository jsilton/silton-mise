## Chef's Note

This homemade enchilada sauce builds deeper flavor than store-bought versions by toasting chili powder and cumin directly in the hot oil-flour roux before adding liquid. This blooming technique releases the spices' fat-soluble aromatic oils. A splash of apple cider vinegar at the end brightens the earthy cumin and tomato paste.

## Directions

1.  **The Roux:** In a medium saucepan, heat oil over medium. Whisk in the flour and all the spices (The Bloom). Cook, whisking constantly, for 1 minute until fragrant and the color deepens.
2.  **Emulsify:** Whisk in the tomato paste until smooth.
3.  **The Liquid:** Slowly pour in the broth while whisking vigorously to remove all lumps.
4.  **Simmer:** Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5-7 minutes until the sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon.
5.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Whisk in the vinegar and black pepper. Taste and add more salt if needed.
6.  **Store:** Use immediately or store in a glass jar in the fridge for up to 1 week.
