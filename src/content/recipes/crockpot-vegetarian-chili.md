## Chef's Note
This is the "Gold Standard" for plant-based comfort. Most vegetarian chilis are thin or watery; we solve this with **Texture Integrity** through the **Sweet Potato Thickener Pattern**. As the sweet potato simmers for 4 hours, it partially breaks down, releasing starches that create a rich, velvety body without the need for a roux. We use a **Triple Bean Pattern** to ensure a complex "Bounce" in every spoonful. The mandatory **Acid Finish** (apple cider vinegar) provides the "High Note" needed to wake up the earthy spices.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** Place the diced onion, celery, carrot, peppers, and sweet potato in the bottom of the crockpot.
2.  **The Mix:** Add all three types of beans, green chiles, diced tomatoes, and tomato sauce.
3.  **Season:** Sprinkle the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and pepper over the top. Pour in the water or stock and stir until well combined.
4.  **Cook:** Cover and cook on **HIGH for 4 hours** or **LOW for 8 hours** until the sweet potatoes are tender and the flavors have melded.
5.  **The Finish:** 5 minutes before serving, stir in the **Apple Cider Vinegar**. Taste and adjust salt if needed.
6.  **Serve:** Ladle into deep bowls. Top with Greek yogurt, avocado, and fresh cilantro.
