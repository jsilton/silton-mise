## Chef's Note

Vodka sauce is a purely Italian-American invention from 1970s New York, with multiple restaurants claiming to have created it first. The vodka doesn't add much flavor itself - instead, it acts as an emulsifier, helping fat-soluble tomato flavors and water-soluble cream bind together into a stable sauce. Some say it also releases flavor compounds in tomatoes that aren't soluble in water or fat alone. The result is a distinctly creamy-yet-bright pink sauce that's become an Italian-American classic. Let the vodka simmer for a full minute to cook off the harsh alcohol while concentrating its subtle notes.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook rigatoni until **very al dente**. Drain.
2.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet, heat 1 tbsp oil. Sauté broccoli for 5 minutes until tender-crisp. Remove. Sauté shrimp for 3 minutes until pink. Remove.
3.  **The Emulsion:** Wipe the pan. Add 1 tbsp oil and garlic; sauté for 30 seconds. Pour in the vodka. Let it bubble for 1 minute.
4.  **Bind:** Add the marinara sauce and heavy cream. Bring to a low simmer for 5 minutes until the sauce is a deep, creamy orange.
5.  **Combine:** Return the pasta, broccoli, and shrimp to the skillet. Stir in half the fresh basil.
6.  **Toss:** Toss over medium heat for 1 minute until the sauce clings to the rigatoni.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with the remaining basil and a "High Note" pat of Parmesan.
