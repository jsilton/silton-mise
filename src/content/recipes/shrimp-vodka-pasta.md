## Chef's Note

The secret to a professional vodka sauce is **The Burn-Off Pattern**. You must simmer the vodka with the garlic for exactly 1 minute _before_ adding the marinara; this evaporates the harsh ethanol while concentrating the floral aromatics of the spirit. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The Staged Sauté**: we sear the broccoli and shrimp separately and remove them, adding them back only in the final minute. This ensures the broccoli has a smoky "Snap" and the shrimp maintain their "Bounce."

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook rigatoni until **very al dente**. Drain.
2.  **The Snap:** In a large skillet, heat 1 tbsp oil. Sauté broccoli for 5 minutes until tender-crisp. Remove. Sauté shrimp for 3 minutes until pink. Remove.
3.  **The Emulsion:** Wipe the pan. Add 1 tbsp oil and garlic; sauté for 30 seconds. Pour in the vodka. Let it bubble for 1 minute.
4.  **Bind:** Add the marinara sauce and heavy cream. Bring to a low simmer for 5 minutes until the sauce is a deep, creamy orange.
5.  **Combine:** Return the pasta, broccoli, and shrimp to the skillet. Stir in half the fresh basil.
6.  **Toss:** Toss over medium heat for 1 minute until the sauce clings to the rigatoni.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with the remaining basil and a "High Note" pat of Parmesan.
