## Chef's Note

This is a spring variation on Roman pasta alla carbonara, adding peas which come into season in Italy in April and May. The traditional Roman combination of cured pork (usually guanciale or pancetta) with pasta water creates a creamy emulsion without needing cream. Mini-shells are perfect here because the sauce gets trapped inside each shell. Fresh mint with peas is a classic Italian combination - you'll find it in dishes like "pasta e piselli" (pasta and peas). Render the bacon fat slowly so it becomes your cooking fat, then use it with pasta water and cheese to create the sauce. The lemon juice cuts through the richness.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water for 1 minute **less** than package directions. **Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water** before draining.
2.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet, melt the butter and add the bacon slivers. Fry over medium heat until golden and crispy.
3.  **Aromatics:** Add the frozen peas directly to the hot bacon fat. Stir for 2 minutes until just heated through.
4.  **Bind:** Stir in the crème fraîche and chopped mint.
5.  **Emulsify:** Add the hot pasta and the reserved pasta water to the skillet. Pour in the lemon juice.
6.  **Toss:** Toss vigorously over medium-low heat for 1 minute. Add the Parmesan one handful at a time, stirring until the sauce is glossy and thick.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with extra mint and plenty of black pepper.
