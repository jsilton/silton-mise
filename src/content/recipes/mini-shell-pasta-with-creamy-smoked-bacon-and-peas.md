## Chef's Note

This spring pasta variation adds peas, which come into season in Italy in April and May. The traditional Italian combination of cured pork with pasta water creates creamy emulsion without needing cream—though this version adds a touch of crème fraîche. Mini-shells trap sauce inside each piece. Fresh mint with peas is a classic Italian pairing found in "pasta e piselli." Render bacon fat slowly so it becomes your cooking fat, then combine with pasta water and cheese to create the sauce. Lemon juice cuts through richness.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water for 1 minute **less** than package directions. **Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water** before draining.
2.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet, melt the butter and add the bacon slivers. Fry over medium heat until golden and crispy.
3.  **Aromatics:** Add the frozen peas directly to the hot bacon fat. Stir for 2 minutes until just heated through.
4.  **Bind:** Stir in the crème fraîche and chopped mint.
5.  **Emulsify:** Add the hot pasta and the reserved pasta water to the skillet. Pour in the lemon juice.
6.  **Toss:** Toss vigorously over medium-low heat for 1 minute. Add the Parmesan one handful at a time, stirring until the sauce is glossy and thick.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with extra mint and plenty of black pepper.
