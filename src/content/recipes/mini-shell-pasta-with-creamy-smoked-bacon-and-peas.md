## Chef's Note

This is a 25-minute quick hero that relies on **The Emulsion Method**. The secret to the Kitchen Standard is combining the **Smoked Bacon Render** with starchy pasta water and crème fraîche. This creates a thick, velvet-like sauce that finds its way inside every mini-shell. We maintain **Textural Balance** by adding the peas at the very end—they should stay bright green and "Snappy." The fresh mint and lemon juice provide the mandatory **Acid/Aromatic Finish** to cut through the heavy bacon fat.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water for 1 minute **less** than package directions. **Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water** before draining.
2.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet, melt the butter and add the bacon slivers. Fry over medium heat until golden and crispy.
3.  **Aromatics:** Add the frozen peas directly to the hot bacon fat. Stir for 2 minutes until just heated through.
4.  **Bind:** Stir in the crème fraîche and chopped mint.
5.  **Emulsify:** Add the hot pasta and the reserved pasta water to the skillet. Pour in the lemon juice.
6.  **Toss:** Toss vigorously over medium-low heat for 1 minute. Add the Parmesan one handful at a time, stirring until the sauce is glossy and thick.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with extra mint and plenty of black pepper.
