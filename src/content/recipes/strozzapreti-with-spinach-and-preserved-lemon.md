## Chef's Note

The secret to this "Restaurant Quality" pasta is **Texture Integrity** through **The Panko Snap Pattern**. We fry the panko in garlic-infused butter until deep golden _before_ starting the pasta; this provides a shatteringly crisp contrast to the soft, chewy strozzapreti. We use **Preserved Lemon** as the mandatory savory-salt **High Note**—its fermented depth creates a "Bounce" that standard citrus cannot replicate. The brown butter provides the rich, nutty foundation that ties the earthy spinach together.

## Directions

1.  **The Snap:** In a large skillet, melt 2 tbsp butter with 2 tbsp olive oil. Sauté garlic and red pepper flakes for 1 minute. Add panko and cook until mahogany brown (2 mins). Stir in lemon zest. Remove to a plate.
2.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in a massive pot of salted water until **very al dente** (5 mins for fresh). Drain.
3.  **Brown Butter:** In the same skillet, melt remaining 6 tbsp butter. Whisk over medium for 3 minutes until foamy and dark brown.
4.  **The Wilt:** Add half of the spinach to the butter. Toss for 1 minute until collapsed.
5.  **Bind:** Add the hot pasta, lemon juice, and preserved lemon. Toss vigorously. Add the remaining spinach and toss for 30 seconds.
6.  **Serve:** Divide into bowls. Top with a massive pile of the reserved garlic-lemon panko for the final **High Note**.
