## Chef's Note

Strozzapreti ("priest stranglers") is a hand-rolled pasta shape from Emilia-Romagna and other Italian regions. Browning panko breadcrumbs in garlic butter before starting the pasta gives you a crispy topping that contrasts beautifully with the soft, chewy noodles. Preserved lemon adds a fermented, salty complexity that fresh citrus can't match—it's become popular in modern Italian cooking though it originally comes from North African cuisine. Brown butter ties the earthy spinach and bright lemon together.

## Directions

1.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet, melt 2 tbsp butter with 2 tbsp olive oil. Sauté garlic and red pepper flakes for 1 minute. Add panko and cook until mahogany brown (2 mins). Stir in lemon zest. Remove to a plate.
2.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in a massive pot of salted water until **very al dente** (5 mins for fresh). Drain.
3.  **Brown Butter:** In the same skillet, melt remaining 6 tbsp butter. Whisk over medium for 3 minutes until foamy and dark brown.
4.  **The Wilt:** Add half of the spinach to the butter. Toss for 1 minute until collapsed.
5.  **Bind:** Add the hot pasta, lemon juice, and preserved lemon. Toss vigorously. Add the remaining spinach and toss for 30 seconds.
6.  **Serve:** Divide into bowls. Top with a massive pile of the reserved garlic-lemon panko for the final **High Note**.
