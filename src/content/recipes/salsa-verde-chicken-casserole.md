## Chef's Note

This Tex-Mex casserole is a quick weeknight meal that layers chicken, tortillas, and cheese like lasagna. Whisking salsa verde into sour cream creates a tangy, creamy sauce that keeps the chicken moist during baking. Halving the corn tortillas allows for neat, sturdy layers that slice cleanly. Fresh avocado and tomatoes add brightness.

## Directions

1.  **The Bind:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the sour cream and 1 cup of the salsa verde.
2.  **Combine:** Fold the shredded chicken and cilantro into the sauce.
3.  **Layer:** Grease an 8x8 baking dish. Spread a thin layer of the remaining salsa on the bottom. Top with 4 halved tortillas.
4.  **Stack:** Spread half the chicken mixture over the tortillas and top with 1 cup of cheese. Repeat with remaining tortillas, chicken, and cheese.
5.  **Bake:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Bake for 25-30 minutes until the cheese is bubbling and the edges are golden brown.
6.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Top with the chopped tomatoes and sliced avocado for the final **High Note**.
7.  **Serve:** Serve hot with a side of [Cilantro Lime Rice](/mise/recipes/cilantro-lime-rice).
