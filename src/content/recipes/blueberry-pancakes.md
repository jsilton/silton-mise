## Chef's Note

Letting the batter rest for 5 minutes after mixing allows flour to hydrate and gluten to relax, creating fluffier pancakes. Honey instead of granulated sugar produces deeper caramelization on the edges. Sprinkle blueberries onto each pancake after pouring it on the griddle rather than mixing them into batter - this prevents purple streaking from berry juice.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Heat a griddle to 350°F (or a large non-stick skillet over medium-low heat). Lightly grease with butter.
2.  **Aeration:** In a large bowl, whisk eggs, milk, and vanilla until light and frothy (about 2-3 minutes). Whisk in the melted butter and honey.
3.  **Combine:** Sift in the flour, salt, and baking powder. Stir with a spatula until **just combined**. A few lumps are mandatory—do not overmix!
4.  **The Rest:** Let the batter sit for 5 minutes. It will thicken and become slightly bubbly.
5.  **Pour:** Use a 1/4 cup scoop to drop batter onto the hot griddle. Immediately sprinkle 1 tbsp of blueberries onto the wet surface of each pancake.
6.  **Flip:** Cook for 2 minutes until bubbles form and pop on the surface and the bottom is golden. Flip and cook for another 2 minutes.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with salted butter and warm maple syrup.
