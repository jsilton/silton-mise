## Chef's Note

The secret to a fluffy restaurant-quality pancake is **Textural Balance** through the **Batter Rest**. After mixing, you must let the batter sit for 5 minutes; this allows the flour to fully hydrate and the gluten to relax. We also use **Honey** instead of granulated sugar to create a deeper, more caramelized Crunch on the edges. Always sprinkle the blueberries on top of the pancake while it's on the griddle rather than mixing them in—this prevents the juice from bleeding and turning your pancakes purple.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Heat a griddle to 350°F (or a large non-stick skillet over medium-low heat). Lightly grease with butter.
2.  **Aeration:** In a large bowl, whisk eggs, milk, and vanilla until light and frothy (about 2-3 minutes). Whisk in the melted butter and honey.
3.  **Combine:** Sift in the flour, salt, and baking powder. Stir with a spatula until **just combined**. A few lumps are mandatory—do not overmix!
4.  **The Rest:** Let the batter sit for 5 minutes. It will thicken and become slightly bubbly.
5.  **Pour:** Use a 1/4 cup scoop to drop batter onto the hot griddle. Immediately sprinkle 1 tbsp of blueberries onto the wet surface of each pancake.
6.  **Flip:** Cook for 2 minutes until bubbles form and pop on the surface and the bottom is golden. Flip and cook for another 2 minutes.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with salted butter and warm maple syrup.
