## Chef's Note

This is the "Kitchen Standard" for meal-prep breakfasts. We use **The Blender Method** to transform standard rolled oats into a smooth, cake-like batter. The secret to the Kitchen Standard here is the **Acid Balance**: the tart, seed-studded raspberry jam provides a sharp "High Note" that cuts through the dense, earthy cacao. By letting this set overnight, the chia seeds fully hydrate, giving the oats a pudding-like Texture that keeps you full until lunch.

## Directions

1.  **The Jam:** Place raspberries in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat until they break down into a compote. Stir in 1 tbsp chia seeds and let sit for 5 minutes to thicken.
2.  **The Base:** Combine all blended oats ingredients in a high-powered blender. Blend for 60 seconds until perfectly smooth.
3.  **Layer:** Divide the raspberry jam among 4 jars. Pour the blended oat mixture over the jam.
4.  **The Cap:** Drizzle the melted dark chocolate over the top of each jar to create a Crunch layer.
5.  **The Finish:** Seal the jars and refrigerate for at least 90 minutes (or ideally overnight). The mixture will firm up significantly as the oats and chia seeds absorb the liquid.
6.  **Serve:** These keep for up to 5 days. Eat cold straight from the jar.
