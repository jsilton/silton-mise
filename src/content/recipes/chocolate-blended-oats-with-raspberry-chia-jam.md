## Directions

1. Making blended oats is very simple and it should only take you about 10 minutes from start to finish. You’ll start by making the raspberry chia jam, then blending up the oats and layering the two into jars or individual containers.
2. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to make your Chocolate Blended Oats:
3. Step One: Place raspberries in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until the raspberries are warm and have broken down to a lumpy, compote-like texture. Add the chia seeds and stir to combine. Set aside.
4. Step Two: Combine all Chocolate Blended Oats ingredients in a high-powered blender.
5. Step Three: The blended oats mixture will be a little runny at first but will slowly thicken to a batter like consistency as it sets.
6. Step Four: Divide the raspberry chia jam amongst four jars, then pour the oats over the top. Seal and keep in the fridge for up to 5 days.
7. Substitutions and Variations
8. Milk Alternatives: You can use any kind of milk you’d like! I prefer to use fortified soy milk because it is a good source of protein and has the closest nutritional profile to dairy milk. Any other plant-based milk will also work though. Of course, if you’re not plant-based, you could use dairy milk.
9. Berry Swap: Substitute frozen raspberries with frozen strawberries, blueberries, or mixed berries. Any berry will work here. If using blueberries, cherries, strawberries or any firm berry with a skin, you will need to mash it with a fork to help break it down.
10. Omit Chia Seeds: If you want a slightly less thick consistency to the blended oats, you can leave out the chia seeds. You could also leave them out of the jam if needed, but of course it will be very runny.
11. Protein Boost: If you want to boost the protein content, add a scoop (about 2 tbsp) of chocolate protein powder to the blended oats.
12. Combine all Chocolate Blended Oats ingredients in a high powered blender. Blend for 60 seconds or until mostly smooth. The mixture will be quite runny at first – this is fine. It will firm up in the fridge as the oats and chia seeds absorb the liquid.
13. Divide the chocolate blended oats between 4 individual jars or containers. Top with melted dark chocolate.
14. Seal the jars and chill, in the fridge overnight (or for at least 90 minutes). They will keep for up to 5 days.
