## Chef's Note

This is the definitive restorative soup. The secret to its elite "Velvet" texture is **Culinary Technique** through **The Butter-Roux Method**. Unlike standard soups, we use a massive half-pound of butter to sauté the onions; this provides a fat-moisture barrier that results in a soup with an incredible Texture and sheen. We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The 30-Minute Low-Simmer**: we cook the tomatoes until the cellulose breaks down completely, then finish with **Half-and-Half and Honey** for a mandatory **Acid-Sweet Finish** that bridge the tart tomatoes.

## Directions

1.  **Foundation:** In a massive pot, melt the butter over medium-low. Add onions and cook gently for 20 minutes until translucent and soft. **Do not brown.**
2.  **The Roux:** Whisk in the flour. Cook for 3 minutes until the mixture looks like pale gold sand.
3.  **Simmer:** Stir in the tomatoes, broth, sugar, honey, celery salt, and pepper. Bring to a gentle bubble.
4.  **Reduce:** Lower heat to **very low**. Simmer for 30 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pot frequently to prevent the flour from scorching.
5.  **The Emulsion:** Stir in the half-and-half. Remove from heat.
6.  **Puree:** Use a high-speed blender to puree the soup until completely smooth and mirror-glossy.
7.  **Serve:** Return to low heat just to warm through. Serve hot.
