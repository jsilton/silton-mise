## Chef's Note

This is classic restorative tomato soup. The key to its velvety texture is using a half-pound of butter to sauté the onions, which provides a rich base that results in a soup with incredible body and sheen. We cook the tomatoes for 30 minutes until the cellulose breaks down completely, then finish with half-and-half and honey to balance the tart tomatoes.

## Directions

1.  **Foundation:** In a massive pot, melt the butter over medium-low. Add onions and cook gently for 20 minutes until translucent and soft. **Do not brown.**
2.  **The Roux:** Whisk in the flour. Cook for 3 minutes until the mixture looks like pale gold sand.
3.  **Simmer:** Stir in the tomatoes, broth, sugar, honey, celery salt, and pepper. Bring to a gentle bubble.
4.  **Reduce:** Lower heat to **very low**. Simmer for 30 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pot frequently to prevent the flour from scorching.
5.  **The Emulsion:** Stir in the half-and-half. Remove from heat.
6.  **Puree:** Use a high-speed blender to puree the soup until completely smooth and mirror-glossy.
7.  **Serve:** Return to low heat just to warm through. Serve hot.
