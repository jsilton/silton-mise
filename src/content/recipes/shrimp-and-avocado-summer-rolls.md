## Chef's Note
Summer rolls are a masterclass in **Texture Integrity**. The secret to Success is **The Cold Snap Pattern**: you must cook the shrimp and vermicelli separately and then plunge them into an ice-water bath. This stops the cooking instantly and ensures the shrimp maintain a resilient "Snap" rather than turning mushy. We use **The 30-Second Soak**: dipping the rice paper into warm water for exactly 30 seconds ensures it has the "Bounce" to roll tightly without tearing. The bird chile sauce provide the mandatory savory-sweet **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **Noodles:** Soak vermicelli in boiling water for 10 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water until stone-cold. Pat **bone-dry**.
2.  **The Snap:** Boil shrimp in salted water for exactly 2 minutes until just opaque. Shock in ice water for 5 minutes. Pat dry and halve lengthwise.
3.  **The Sauce:** In a small jar, whisk sugar, water, lime juice, chile, and garlic until the sugar dissolves.
4.  **Assemble:** Dip 1 rice paper wrapper in warm water for 30 seconds. Lay flat.
5.  **Layer:** In the center, place a small pile of noodles, 3 shrimp halves (pink side down), a slice of avocado, and a generous amount of herbs.
6.  **The Roll:** Fold the bottom of the wrapper over the filling, tuck in the sides, and roll tightly into a cylinder.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with the dipping sauce.
