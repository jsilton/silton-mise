## Chef's Note

Summer rolls require careful attention to texture. The secret is the ice-water bath: you must cook the shrimp and vermicelli separately and then plunge them into ice water. This stops the cooking instantly and ensures the shrimp maintain a firm snap rather than turning mushy. Dip the rice paper into warm water for exactly 30 seconds so it has the right pliability to roll tightly without tearing. The bird chile sauce provides the essential savory-sweet contrast.

## Directions

1.  **Noodles:** Soak vermicelli in boiling water for 10 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water until stone-cold. Pat **bone-dry**.
2.  **The Crunch:** Boil shrimp in salted water for exactly 2 minutes until just opaque. Shock in ice water for 5 minutes. Pat dry and halve lengthwise.
3.  **The Sauce:** In a small jar, whisk sugar, water, lime juice, chile, and garlic until the sugar dissolves.
4.  **Assemble:** Dip 1 rice paper wrapper in warm water for 30 seconds. Lay flat.
5.  **Layer:** In the center, place a small pile of noodles, 3 shrimp halves (pink side down), a slice of avocado, and a generous amount of herbs.
6.  **The Roll:** Fold the bottom of the wrapper over the filling, tuck in the sides, and roll tightly into a cylinder.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with the dipping sauce.
