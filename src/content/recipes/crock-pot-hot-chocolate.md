## Directions

1. Whisk together the sugar and cocoa powder in a 6-quart slow cooker. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to incorporate. Whisk in the heavy cream, chopped chocolate, vanilla extract, and instant espresso.
2. Cover and cook on low heat, whisking occasionally, until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is hot and well combined, about 2 hours. Add the marshmallows and cook until the marshmallows begin to melt into the hot chocolate, about 2 minutes. Stir in the Irish cream liqueur, if using.
3. Set the slow cooker to warm. Ladle the hot chocolate into serving mugs, and top with more marshmallows and shaved chocolate, if you like.
