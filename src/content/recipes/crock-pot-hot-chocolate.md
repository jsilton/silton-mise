## Chef's Note

While serious chocolatiers prefer the stovetop, the slow cooker is an excellent tool for **gentle tempering**. The low, consistent heat prevents the chocolate from seizing and allows the espresso and vanilla to infuse deeply into the dairy. By using real bittersweet chocolate bars instead of just powder, we transform this from "cocoa" into a rich "drinking chocolate" with a luxurious mouthfeel. A pinch of salt is non-negotiable—it cuts the sweetness and makes the cacao sing.

## Directions

1.  **Whisk:** In a 6-quart slow cooker, whisk together the sugar, cocoa powder, espresso powder, and salt.
2.  **Incorporate:** Gradually pour in the milk and heavy cream, whisking constantly until the powder is mostly dissolved.
3.  **Melt:** Stir in the chopped bittersweet chocolate and vanilla extract.
4.  **Slow Cook:** Cover and cook on **LOW** for 2 hours. Whisk vigorously every 30-45 minutes to ensure the chocolate emulsifies with the dairy.
5.  **Finish:** Just before serving, stir in the liqueur (if using).
6.  **Serve:** Ladle into mugs. Top with fresh marshmallows and shaved chocolate.
