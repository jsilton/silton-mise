## Chef's Note

These are nutritious breakfast muffins. We blend the rolled oats into a smooth, nutrient-dense flour directly with the wet ingredients. The key is skipping refined flour entirely and relying on the pumpkin and oats to achieve a dense, moist texture that never turns crumbly. These freeze perfectly and can be pulled out for a quick breakfast or lunch component.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Grease a standard 12-cup muffin tin or use silicone liners.
2.  **Blend:** Combine oats, pumpkin puree, milk, maple syrup, eggs, spices, baking soda, vanilla, and salt in a high-powered blender.
3.  **Pulverize:** Blend on high for 60 seconds until the batter is perfectly smooth and the oats have transformed into flour.
4.  **Fill:** Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups (about 3/4 full). If using chocolate chips, sprinkle them onto the top of each muffin now for a visual "High Note."
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 20-22 minutes until firm to the touch and the edges are lightly golden.
6.  **Cool:** Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes to allow the oat structure to set.
7.  **Store:** These keep in the fridge for 5 days or the freezer for 3 months.
