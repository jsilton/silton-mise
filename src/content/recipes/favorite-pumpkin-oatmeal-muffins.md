## Chef's Note

This is our favorite high-performance nutritious breakfast. We use **The Blender Method** to pulverize the rolled oats into a smooth, nutrient-dense "flour" directly with the wet ingredients. The secret to the Kitchen Standard is **Textural Balance**: by skipping refined flour entirely and relying on the pumpkin and oats, we achieve a dense, moist Texture that never turns crumbly. These are explicitly designed for **Modularity**—they freeze perfectly and can be pulled out for a high-protein lunch component.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Grease a standard 12-cup muffin tin or use silicone liners.
2.  **Blend:** Combine oats, pumpkin puree, milk, maple syrup, eggs, spices, baking soda, vanilla, and salt in a high-powered blender.
3.  **Pulverize:** Blend on high for 60 seconds until the batter is perfectly smooth and the oats have transformed into flour.
4.  **Fill:** Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups (about 3/4 full). If using chocolate chips, sprinkle them onto the top of each muffin now for a visual "High Note."
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 20-22 minutes until firm to the touch and the edges are lightly golden.
6.  **Cool:** Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes to allow the oat structure to set.
7.  **Store:** These keep in the fridge for 5 days or the freezer for 3 months.
