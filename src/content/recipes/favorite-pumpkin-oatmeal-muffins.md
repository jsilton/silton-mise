## Directions

1. Here’s a look at the process involved in making these muffins. Scroll down to the bottom of this post for the full recipe.

3. Blend until very smooth.
4. Portion into a muffin tin.
5. Top with chocolate chips and bake.
6. Storing Healthy Pumpkin Muffins
7. These muffins are super moist and store well in the fridge or freezer—which is handy for pulling out quick breakfasts and snacks all week long. I also love them as a simple lunch component paired with fruit and a simple veggie for lunch.
8. Best Tips for Success
9. These muffins can store in the fridge in an airtight container for 3-5 days. Or in the freezer in a zip top freezer bag for up to 3 months. Thaw in the fridge or at room temperature.
10. Serve cold or slightly warmed. Dice into smaller pieces for younger kids.
11. Dairy-free: Use plain unsweetened nondairy milk.
12. Gluten-free: Use certified gluten-free rolled oats.
13. Be sure to use pumpkin puree, not pie filling.
14. Use honey instead of maple syrup if desired. (Do not use honey for kids under age one.)
15. For mini muffins, bake for 12-14 minutes or until a cake tester inserted into the centers comes out cleanly.
16. If you love the flavor of pumpkin pie, use 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice.
17. To make these by hand without a blender or food processor, use store-bought oat flour and mix the ingredients together in a mixing bowl.
18. Add a few chocolate chips to the tops of each muffin if desired.

20. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and grease a standard size muffin tin.
21. Place all of the ingredients into a blender or food processor except the chocolate chips.
22. Blend until very smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl if needed.
23. Divide among the prepared muffin tin. You want each cup to be about ¾ full. Top with chocolate chips if using.
24. Bake for 20-22 minutes or until firm to the touch and lightly golden brown around the edges. Let cool in the pan for 5-10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool.
25. Serve warm, at room temperature, or chilled.
