## Chef's Note

"Dry" scallops (without chemical additives like sodium tripolyphosphate) sear better than "wet" scallops. Patting them completely dry with paper towels before searing ensures an immediate, mahogany crust while the center stays sweet and buttery. Sautéing fresh corn in rendered bacon fat bridges the smoky pork and delicate seafood, while lemon juice adds brightness that cuts through the rich bacon and avocado.

## Directions

1.  **Relish:** Use the "Inverted Bowl Hack" to cut corn kernels into a large bowl. Add onion, pepper, and 1 tbsp parsley.
2.  **Sauté:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large skillet. Sauté the corn mixture for 5 minutes until tender and caramelized. Remove from heat and let cool for 2 minutes.
3.  **Bind:** Fold in the diced avocados and crispy bacon. Season with salt and plenty of black pepper.
4.  **The Crunch:** Wipe the skillet. Heat oil over high until just beginning to smoke. Season scallops with salt. Sear for exactly **1 minute per side** until a deep golden crust forms. Remove immediately.
5.  **Assemble:** Mound the warm corn-avocado relish on 4 plates. Top each with 4 seared scallops.
6.  **Finish:** Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the scallops and garnish with the remaining parsley for the final **High Note**.
