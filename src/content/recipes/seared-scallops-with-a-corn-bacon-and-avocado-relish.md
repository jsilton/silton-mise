## Chef's Note

The secret to "Restaurant Quality" scallops is **Texture Integrity** through **The Dry Sear Pattern**. You must use "Dry" scallops (no chemical additives) and pat them with paper towels until they are **bone-dry** before they hit the pan. This ensures an immediate, mahogany "Snap" on the surface while the center remains a sweet, buttery "Bounce." We use **The Bacon-Corn Bind**: sautéing the corn in the rendered bacon fat bridges the gap between the smoky pork and the delicate seafood. The lemon provides the mandatory **Acid Finish**.

## Directions

1.  **Relish:** Use the "Inverted Bowl Hack" to cut corn kernels into a large bowl. Add onion, pepper, and 1 tbsp parsley.
2.  **Sauté:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large skillet. Sauté the corn mixture for 5 minutes until tender and caramelized. Remove from heat and let cool for 2 minutes.
3.  **Bind:** Fold in the diced avocados and crispy bacon. Season with salt and plenty of black pepper.
4.  **The Snap:** Wipe the skillet. Heat oil over high until just beginning to smoke. Season scallops with salt. Sear for exactly **1 minute per side** until a deep golden crust forms. Remove immediately.
5.  **Assemble:** Mound the warm corn-avocado relish on 4 plates. Top each with 4 seared scallops.
6.  **Finish:** Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the scallops and garnish with the remaining parsley for the final **High Note**.
