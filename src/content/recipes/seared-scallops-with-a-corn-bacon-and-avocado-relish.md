## Directions

1. Take a small bowl and place it upside-down inside a large bowl. (This will provide a small stand for your corn, making it easier to remove the kernels, and the large bowl will catch them as the fall, avoiding a mess.) Using a knife, remove the kernels from the corn, letting them fall into the bowl.
2. Dice the onion and red bell pepper and add them to the bowl with the corn. Add 1 tablespoon of the chopped parsley and season with salt and pepper. Mix to evenly distribute the ingredients.
3. Set a pan over medium heat and add some oil. Add the corn mixture to the pan and cook until the onions begin to soften, tossing occasionally, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool.
4. Sprinkle the sea scallops with salt and pepper. Set a pan over medium-high heat and add some oil. Add the scallops and sear until golden in color, about 1 minute on each side. Remove from the heat and let rest.
5. Dice the avocados and add them to the corn relish along with the chopped bacon. Season with salt and pepper and mix together.
6. Evenly distribute the relish among 4 plates and top each with 4 scallops. Garnish with the remaining 1 tablespoon parsley and a squeeze of lemon.
