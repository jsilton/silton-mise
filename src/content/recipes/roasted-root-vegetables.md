## Chef's Note

The secret to root vegetables that aren't "mushy" is **Uniformity and Space**. You must cut all the vegetables into equal 1-inch chunks so they cook at the same rate. Most importantly, use two baking sheets if necessary—if the vegetables are touching, they will steam; if they have space, they will caramelize and develop a sweet, nutty crust.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Peel and cut all vegetables into uniform 1-inch cubes.
2.  **Toss:** In a large bowl, toss the vegetables with oil, salt, pepper, garlic, and herbs.
3.  **Spread:** Spread in a single layer on two large rimmed baking sheets. **Ensure no chunks are overlapping.**
4.  **Roast:** Bake for 35-40 minutes, tossing with a spatula halfway through, until the edges are dark brown and crispy.
5.  **Finish:** In the final 5 minutes, drizzle the maple syrup and balsamic vinegar over the pan and toss one last time. This creates a sticky, savory-sweet glaze.
