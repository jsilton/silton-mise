Steamed broccoli usually tastes watery. This method fixes that by tossing the broccoli in a "Citronette" (Lemon-Garlic oil) while it is hot and dry, allowing the flavor to absorb into the floret like pasta.

## Directions

1. The Dressing: While water boils, whisk the olive oil, lemon juice, zest, grated garlic, and salt in the bottom of your serving bowl.
2. Steam: Steam broccoli for 4–5 minutes (until tender-crisp).
3. Dry: Remove from steamer and shake off ALL excess water. (Water blocks flavor).
4. Toss: Dump the hot, dry broccoli directly into the serving bowl with the dressing. Toss vigorously. The heat creates a fragrant garlic-lemon sauce that clings to the veg.
