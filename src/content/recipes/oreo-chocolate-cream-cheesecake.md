## Chef's Note
This is the ultimate holiday "Project" dessert. The secret to its incredible "Bounce" is **Structural Science** through **The Room-Temp Emulsion Pattern**: every ingredient, especially the eggs and cream cheese, must be at room temperature before mixing. This ensures a silky, lump-free batter that sets into a firm yet velvety structure. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The Two-Stage Oreo Pattern**: we crush half the cookies for a dense "Snap" base and reserve the other half for large, chunky inclusions inside the cake.

## Directions

1.  **The Crust:** Preheat oven to 325°F. Finely crush 12 Oreo cookies. Press firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Let cool.
2.  **The Base:** In a stand mixer, beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla on medium speed until perfectly smooth. Add melted chocolate; beat to integrate.
3.  **Emulsify:** Add eggs **one at a time**, mixing on low speed after each until just blended. Do not over-beat, or the cheesecake will crack.
4.  **Inclusions:** Gently fold in 1.5 cups of coarsely quartered Oreos. 
5.  **Bake:** Pour the batter over the crust. Sprinkle remaining quartered cookies on top. Bake for 50-60 minutes until the edges are set but the center still has a slight wobble.
6.  **The Set:** Cool in the pan, then refrigerate for **at least 4 hours** (ideally 24).
7.  **Serve:** Run a knife around the rim before releasing. Serve cold.
