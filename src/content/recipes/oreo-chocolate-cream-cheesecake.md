## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate holiday dessert. The secret to its incredible texture is making sure every ingredient, especially the eggs and cream cheese, is at room temperature before mixing. This ensures a silky, lump-free batter that sets into a firm yet velvety structure. We create textural contrast by crushing half the cookies for a dense, crunchy base and reserving the other half for large, chunky inclusions inside the cake.

## Directions

1.  **The Crust:** Preheat oven to 325°F. Finely crush 12 Oreo cookies. Press firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Let cool.
2.  **The Base:** In a stand mixer, beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla on medium speed until perfectly smooth. Add melted chocolate; beat to integrate.
3.  **Emulsify:** Add eggs **one at a time**, mixing on low speed after each until just blended. Do not over-beat, or the cheesecake will crack.
4.  **Inclusions:** Gently fold in 1.5 cups of coarsely quartered Oreos.
5.  **Bake:** Pour the batter over the crust. Sprinkle remaining quartered cookies on top. Bake for 50-60 minutes until the edges are set but the center still has a slight wobble.
6.  **The Finish:** Cool in the pan, then refrigerate for **at least 4 hours** (ideally 24).
7.  **Serve:** Run a knife around the rim before releasing. Serve cold.
