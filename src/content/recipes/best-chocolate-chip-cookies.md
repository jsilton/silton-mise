## Chef's Note

To transform these from "Home" to "Restaurant Quality," we apply two science-backed steps: **Browning the Butter** and **The 24-Hour Rest**. Browning the butter provides a nutty, toffee-like depth, while resting the dough in the fridge allows the enzymes to break down starches into sugars, resulting in a more complex flavor and a superior, chewy texture.

## Directions

1.  **Brown the Butter:** In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Continue cooking, swirling the pan, until the foam subsides and the solids turn a deep golden brown and smell like hazelnuts. Pour into a bowl and let cool until solid but soft.
2.  **Cream:** Beat the cooled brown butter with the brown and white sugars until pale and fluffy (3-5 minutes). Beat in the eggs and vanilla.
3.  **Mix:** Dissolve the baking soda in 1 tsp hot water and add to the batter with the salt. Gently fold in the flour, chocolate chips, and seeds.
4.  **The Rest (Critical):** Wrap the dough and refrigerate for at least **24 hours**. This is the secret to the best cookies.
5.  **Bake:** Scoop onto a parchment-lined sheet. Bake at 350°F for 10-12 minutes until the edges are golden but the centers are still soft.
6.  **Finish:** Sprinkle with a tiny pinch of flaky sea salt immediately.
