## Chef's Note

The chocolate chip cookie was invented by accident in 1938 when Ruth Wakefield, owner of the Toll House Inn in Massachusetts, ran out of baker's chocolate and chopped up a Nestlé chocolate bar instead, expecting it to melt into the dough. It didn't, and the chocolate chip cookie was born - becoming America's most beloved cookie. Nestlé bought the rights to her recipe and printed it on their chocolate chip bags, spreading it across the country. Browning the butter adds a nutty, toffee-like depth that elevates these from good to exceptional.

## Directions

1.  **Brown the Butter:** In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Continue cooking, swirling the pan, until the foam subsides and the solids turn a deep golden brown and smell like hazelnuts. Pour into a bowl and let cool until solid but soft.
2.  **Cream:** Beat the cooled brown butter with the brown and white sugars until pale and fluffy (3-5 minutes). Beat in the eggs and vanilla.
3.  **Mix:** Dissolve the baking soda in 1 tsp hot water and add to the batter with the salt. Gently fold in the flour, chocolate chips, and seeds.
4.  **The Rest (Critical):** Wrap the dough and refrigerate for at least **24 hours**. This is the secret to the best cookies.
5.  **Bake:** Scoop onto a parchment-lined sheet. Bake at 350°F for 10-12 minutes until the edges are golden but the centers are still soft.
6.  **Finish:** Sprinkle with a tiny pinch of flaky sea salt immediately.
