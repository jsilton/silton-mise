## Chef's Note

This is a baseline quick side that relies on **Culinary Technique**. The secret to Success is **The Onion Shock Method**: you must soak the red onion slices in ice water for 10 minutes before adding them to the salad. This removes the harsh sulfurous "bite," leaving only a sweet Crunch that won't overpower the delicate Bosc pear. We use **The Emulsion Method**: whisking the Dijon and vinegar with honey creates a stable, thick binding that has the Texture to coat the spinach leaves without weighing them down.

## Directions

1.  **Shock:** Place sliced red onions in a bowl of ice water. Let stand for 10 minutes. Drain and pat **bone-dry**.
2.  **The Dressing:** In a small jar, whisk together Dijon, vinegar, oil, honey, water, salt, and pepper until thick and opaque.
3.  **Assemble:** Place the baby spinach and sliced pears in a large bowl. Add the dry red onions.
4.  **Bind:** Drizzle 3 tbsp of the dressing over the salad. Toss gently with your hands until every leaf is lightly glossy.
5.  **Serve:** Season with an extra crack of black pepper. Serve immediately to maintain **Textural Balance**.
