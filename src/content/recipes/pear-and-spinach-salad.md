## Chef's Note

This is a quick side salad with bright flavors. The secret is soaking the red onion slices in ice water for 10 minutes before adding them to the salad. This removes the harsh sulfurous bite, leaving only sweet crunch that won't overpower the delicate Bosc pear. Whisking the Dijon and vinegar with honey creates a stable, thick dressing that coats the spinach leaves without weighing them down.

## Directions

1.  **Shock:** Place sliced red onions in a bowl of ice water. Let stand for 10 minutes. Drain and pat **bone-dry**.
2.  **The Dressing:** In a small jar, whisk together Dijon, vinegar, oil, honey, water, salt, and pepper until thick and opaque.
3.  **Assemble:** Place the baby spinach and sliced pears in a large bowl. Add the dry red onions.
4.  **Bind:** Drizzle 3 tbsp of the dressing over the salad. Toss gently with your hands until every leaf is lightly glossy.
5.  **Serve:** Season with an extra crack of black pepper. Serve immediately to maintain **Textural Balance**.
