## Chef's Note

Wild rice needs 45-50 minutes of simmering to fully bloom - the grains split slightly and release starch that naturally thickens the soup. Using both breast and thigh meat provides textural variety in every spoonful. Lemon juice stirred in at the end brightens the earthy, nutty flavors.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** Heat oil in a large pot. Sauté the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic for 10 minutes until soft and starting to turn golden.
2.  **Simmer Rice:** Add the broth and the wild rice. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low and cover. Simmer for 40 minutes.
3.  **Poach Chicken:** Add the diced chicken to the pot. Season with salt, pepper, and herbs. Continue simmering for 15-20 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the rice is tender.
4.  **Finish:** Stir in the fresh parsley and lemon juice.
5.  **Adjust:** If the soup is too thick (wild rice absorbs a lot of liquid), add a splash more broth.
