## Chef's Note

Panang is the richest and sweetest of the Thai curries, defined by its thick, nutty sauce. The secret is **Cracking the Cream**: by frying the curry paste in the thick solids at the top of the coconut milk can, you release the oil-soluble aromatics that would otherwise stay trapped. If your family avoids nuts, use **Toasted Sunflower Seeds** or Panko for that signature Panang crunch.

## Directions

1.  **Crack the Cream:** Spoon 1/2 cup of the thick coconut cream from the top of the can into a wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Stir until it begins to bubble and the oil separates (looks "cracked").
2.  **Bloom:** Add the curry paste to the cracked cream. Fry for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the paste is fragrant and darkens.
3.  **The Sauce:** Stir in the rest of the coconut milk, palm sugar, and fish sauce.
4.  **Poach:** Add the chicken and bell peppers. Simmer gently for 10-12 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened.
5.  **Infuse:** Stir in the torn kaffir lime leaves.
6.  **Finish:** Turn off the heat. Stir in the Thai basil.
7.  **Serve:** Serve over [Jasmine Rice](/mise/recipes/homemade-rice-pilaf). Top with crushed seeds for texture.
