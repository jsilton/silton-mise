## Chef's Note

Roasting green beans at 425°F evaporates their moisture and caramelizes the tips, creating a crispy texture that mimics french fries rather than the soggy texture of boiled or steamed beans. This makes them far more appealing to kids who might otherwise refuse vegetables.

## Directions

1.  **Preheat:** Preheat oven to 425°F.
2.  **Dry:** Ensure green beans are bone-dry (moisture = steam).
3.  **Toss:** On a large baking sheet, toss green beans with oil, garlic powder, and salt. Spread in a **single layer**.
4.  **Roast:** Bake for 10-12 minutes until the skins are shriveled and the tips are dark brown and crispy.
5.  **Finish:** Sprinkle with Parmesan or panko if using and toss. Serve immediately while hot.
