## Chef's Note

The secret to green beans that kids will eat is **High Heat**. By roasting at 425°F, we evaporate the moisture and caramelize the tips, resulting in a texture that mimics a french fry rather than a soggy boiled veggie. This is the **Textural Balance** pattern in action.

## Directions

1.  **Preheat:** Preheat oven to 425°F.
2.  **Dry:** Ensure green beans are bone-dry (moisture = steam).
3.  **Toss:** On a large baking sheet, toss green beans with oil, garlic powder, and salt. Spread in a **single layer**.
4.  **Roast:** Bake for 10-12 minutes until the skins are shriveled and the tips are dark brown and crispy.
5.  **Finish:** Sprinkle with Parmesan or panko if using and toss. Serve immediately while hot.
