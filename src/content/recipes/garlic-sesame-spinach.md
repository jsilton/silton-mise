## Chef's Note

This Korean side dish (sigeumchi namul) blanches spinach for 30 seconds, then shocks it in ice water. After chilling, squeeze the spinach ball bone-dry with your hands - this concentrates flavor and ensures sesame-garlic dressing coats the fibers rather than pooling in water. Raw garlic adds sharp punch.

## Directions

1.  **Blanch:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Submerge the spinach for exactly 30 seconds until bright green and just wilted.
2.  **Shock:** Drain immediately and plunge into a bowl of ice-cold water to stop the cooking (The Ice Shock).
3.  **The Squeeze:** Gather the cold spinach into a ball. Squeeze with both hands until **no more water drips out**. The spinach should look like a dense, dry mass.
4.  **Toss:** In a small bowl, whisk the garlic, sesame oil, and salt. Separate the spinach clumps and toss with the dressing and sesame seeds.
5.  **Serve:** Best served at room temperature or chilled.
