## Chef's Note

This is a baseline **Modularity** component for Korean bowls and a masterclass in **Structural Science**. The secret to the "Restaurant Bounce" is the **Dry Squeeze Pattern**: after blanching and shocking the spinach, you must squeeze it with your hands until it is **bone-dry**. This concentrates the flavor and ensures the sesame-garlic dressing coats the fibers rather than pooling in water. The raw garlic provides the mandatory sharp **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **Blanch:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Submerge the spinach for exactly 30 seconds until bright green and just wilted.
2.  **Shock:** Drain immediately and plunge into a bowl of ice-cold water to stop the cooking (The Ice Shock).
3.  **The Squeeze:** Gather the cold spinach into a ball. Squeeze with both hands until **no more water drips out**. The spinach should look like a dense, dry mass.
4.  **Toss:** In a small bowl, whisk the garlic, sesame oil, and salt. Separate the spinach clumps and toss with the dressing and sesame seeds.
5.  **Serve:** Best served at room temperature or chilled.
