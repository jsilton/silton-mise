## Chef's Note

The secret to spaghetti squash that doesn't feel like a side dish is **Culinary Technique** through **The Bacon-Fat Sear Method**. We roast the squash flesh-side down to maintain moisture , but then toss the "noodles" directly into rendered bacon fat and cream. This creates a savory, emulsified glaze that clings to each strand. We maintain **Textural Balance** by adding the cherry tomatoes and spinach at the very end—this ensures you have bright, crispy bursts of color against the rich Tuscan cream.

## Directions

1.  **Roast Squash:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Halve squash, rub with oil, and roast flesh-side down for 40-45 minutes until fork-tender.
2.  **Shred:** Let cool for 5 minutes. Use two forks to scrape the flesh into "noodles." Set aside.
3.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet, fry bacon until crispy. Remove to a plate, leaving the fat in the pan.
4.  **Aromatics:** Add garlic and cherry tomatoes to the bacon fat. Sauté for 2 minutes until the tomatoes just begin to soften.
5.  **Emulsify:** Pour in the heavy cream and Parmesan. Simmer for 2 minutes until the sauce is thick and bubbly.
6.  **Bind:** Add the spaghetti squash and spinach to the skillet. Toss vigorously for 1 minute until the spinach has collapsed.
7.  **Serve:** Top with the crispy bacon and fresh basil for the final aromatic **High Note**.
