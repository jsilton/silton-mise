## Chef's Note

This is a modern American creation that takes Tuscan flavors (bacon, cream, tomatoes, spinach) and applies them to spaghetti squash, a New World vegetable. Spaghetti squash is native to Mexico and Central America, and the variety we eat today was popularized in Japan and brought to North America in the 1930s. It became trendy in the 2000s as a low-carb pasta substitute. The trick is roasting it cut-side down so moisture doesn't pool in the hollow - this keeps the strands firmer. Tossing the squash in bacon fat and cream transforms it from a sad diet food into something genuinely delicious.

## Directions

1.  **Roast Squash:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Halve squash, rub with oil, and roast flesh-side down for 40-45 minutes until fork-tender.
2.  **Shred:** Let cool for 5 minutes. Use two forks to scrape the flesh into "noodles." Set aside.
3.  **The Crunch:** In a large skillet, fry bacon until crispy. Remove to a plate, leaving the fat in the pan.
4.  **Aromatics:** Add garlic and cherry tomatoes to the bacon fat. Sauté for 2 minutes until the tomatoes just begin to soften.
5.  **Emulsify:** Pour in the heavy cream and Parmesan. Simmer for 2 minutes until the sauce is thick and bubbly.
6.  **Bind:** Add the spaghetti squash and spinach to the skillet. Toss vigorously for 1 minute until the spinach has collapsed.
7.  **Serve:** Top with the crispy bacon and fresh basil for the final aromatic **High Note**.
