## Directions

1. Steps
2. 1. Prepare the Salmon:
3. • Pat salmon fillets dry and season with lemon zest, smoked paprika, and salt.
4. • Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the salmon skin-side down for 4-5 minutes until crisp, then flip and cook for 2-3 minutes until just opaque in the center.
5. 2. Make the Lemon-Herb Emulsion:
6. • In a small bowl, whisk olive oil, lemon juice, grated garlic, honey, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
7. 3. Crispy Chickpeas:
8. • Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Toss chickpeas with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Spread on a baking sheet and roast for 20-25 minutes, shaking the tray halfway through, until golden and crisp.
9. 4. Herbed Orzo Base:
10. • Toss warm cooked orzo with olive oil, lemon juice, cherry tomatoes, feta cheese, parsley, mint, red chili flakes, and roasted chickpeas. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
11. 5. Plate the Dish:
12. • Place a generous portion of herbed orzo on each plate. Top with a salmon fillet, arrange thin radish slices on the orzo for garnish, and drizzle the lemon-herb emulsion around the plate and over the salmon.
