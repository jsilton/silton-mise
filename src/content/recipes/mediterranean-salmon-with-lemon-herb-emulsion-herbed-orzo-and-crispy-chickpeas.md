## Chef's Note

This is a masterclass in **Textural Balance** through **Staged Roasting**. The secret to the Kitchen Standard is **The Crispy Chickpea Method**: we roast the chickpeas at high heat (400°F) until they develop a Crunch that contrasts the soft orzo and succulent salmon. We use **The Emulsion Method**: whisking lemon juice and honey into olive oil creates a thick, glossy "High Note" finish that we drizzle over the salmon _after_ searing to preserve its clean flavor.

## Directions

1.  **Stage 1 (Chickpeas):** Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss bone-dry chickpeas with 1 tbsp oil, smoked paprika, and salt. Roast for 20-25 minutes until golden and very crisp.
2.  **The Salmon:** Season salmon with lemon zest and paprika. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high. Sear salmon **skin-side down** for 4-5 minutes until the skin is shatteringly crisp. Flip and cook for 2 minutes until just opaque. Remove to a plate.
3.  **The Emulsion:** In a small jar, shake together olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, honey, and oregano until thick and opaque.
4.  **The Orzo:** Boil orzo until al dente. Drain and toss with 1 tbsp oil, the roasted chickpeas, tomatoes, feta, and fresh herbs. Season with salt and pepper.
5.  **Assemble:** Place a generous portion of herbed orzo on each plate. Top with a salmon fillet.
6.  **Finish:** Drizzle the lemon-herb emulsion generously over the salmon and greens for the mandatory **Acid Balance**.
