## Chef's Note

Blending oats directly with wet ingredients creates a smooth, cake-like texture that mimics an actual brownie. Natural acids in the banana react with baking soda to provide rise and texture. Finishing with flaky sea salt cuts through the sweetness and enhances the chocolate flavor.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a small oven-safe ramekin or baking dish.
2.  **Blend:** Add oats, banana, egg, milk, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt to a blender. Blend on high until completely smooth.
3.  **Topping:** Pour the batter into the prepared dish. Sprinkle chocolate chips on top.
4.  **Bake:** Bake for 15-18 minutes until the center is set but still slightly soft (like a fudgy brownie).
5.  **Finish:** Sprinkle with a pinch of flaky sea salt and serve warm.
