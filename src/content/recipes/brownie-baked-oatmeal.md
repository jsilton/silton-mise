## Chef's Note

This is a high-speed nutritious breakfast that tastes like a "Comfort" dessert. The secret is **The Blender Method**: by blending the oats into a flour directly with the wet ingredients, we achieve a cake-like **Textural Balance** that mimics a real brownie. We use the **Acid Balance** (from the natural acid in the banana reacting with the baking soda) to provide the Texture and rise. Always finish with flaky sea salt to cut the sweetness.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a small oven-safe ramekin or baking dish.
2.  **Blend:** Add oats, banana, egg, milk, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt to a blender. Blend on high until completely smooth.
3.  **Topping:** Pour the batter into the prepared dish. Sprinkle chocolate chips on top.
4.  **Bake:** Bake for 15-18 minutes until the center is set but still slightly soft (like a fudgy brownie).
5.  **Finish:** Sprinkle with a pinch of flaky sea salt and serve warm.
