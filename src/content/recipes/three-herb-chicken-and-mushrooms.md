## Chef's Note

This recipe uses a skillet-to-oven approach for perfectly cooked chicken. The secret is the cold-start sear: we place the chicken thighs skin-side down in a cold skillet and _then_ turn on the heat; this ensures the fat renders slowly, resulting in shatteringly crisp skin while the meat stays juicy. We use Dijon mustard to emulsify the herb-flecked wine sauce into a thick, glossy coating.

## Directions

1.  **The Sear:** Season chicken with half the rosemary and thyme. Place skin-side down in a cold 12-inch oven-proof skillet. Turn heat to medium-high. Fry for 7 minutes until the skin is deep golden and releases easily.
2.  **Roast:** Flip the chicken. Transfer the entire skillet to a **400°F oven** for 15-20 minutes until the internal temp is 165°F. Remove chicken to a plate.
3.  **The Crunch:** In the same pan (with the chicken fat), sauté mushrooms for 4 minutes until dark and crispy.
4.  **The Roux:** Sprinkle flour over the mushrooms. Stir for 1 minute.
5.  **Emulsify:** Pour in the wine and broth. Whisk in the Dijon mustard. Simmer for 3 minutes until the sauce is thick and bubbly.
6.  **Finish:** Stir in the remaining rosemary, thyme, and parsley for the mandatory aromatic **High Note**.
7.  **Serve:** Spoon the three-herb sauce over the chicken and serve hot.
