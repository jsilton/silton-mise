## Chef's Note

This is the Kitchen Standard for a high-performance nutritious meal. The secret to quinoa that isn't mushy is **Textural Balance** through **The Staged Simmer Method**. We sear the chicken thighs and sauté the mushrooms separately to develop a Crunch crust before adding the broth. By nestling the chicken into the quinoa, we ensure the grains absorb the savory juices of the meat as they bloom. The smoked paprika provides the mandatory savory **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **The Sear:** Season chicken with rosemary and paprika. Heat 1 tsp oil in a large skillet. Sear chicken for 2 minutes per side until golden. Remove to a plate.
2.  **The Veg:** Add the remaining oil to the pan. Sauté onion and mushrooms for 5 minutes until tender and browned.
3.  **The Simmer:** Stir in the dry quinoa and broth. Bring to a boil.
4.  **Nestle:** Place the chicken thighs back into the pan, pressing them down into the quinoa. Cover tightly.
5.  **Cook:** Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15-20 minutes until the liquid is fully absorbed and the chicken is cooked through.
6.  **Wilt:** Remove from heat. Gently stir in the fresh spinach—it will collapse in the residual heat.
7.  **Serve:** Fluff the quinoa with a fork and serve immediately.
