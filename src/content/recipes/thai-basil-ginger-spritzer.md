## Chef's Note

This is a refreshing Thai-inspired garden cocktail. The technique is cold infusion: we boil the sugar and ginger to create a base, but add the Thai basil and Kaffir lime leaves only after removing from heat. This preserves the delicate essential oils, providing a floral brightness that standard syrups lack. We use bruised basil in each glass to ensure the aromatic experience precedes the first sip.

## Directions

1.  **The Syrup:** In a small saucepan, boil water and sugar for 1 minute until dissolved. Remove from heat.
2.  **Infuse:** Add the sliced ginger, basil stems, and kaffir lime leaves. Cover and **let stand for 10 minutes**. Strain into a jar and chill.
3.  **thermal Prep:** Chill 6 glasses in the freezer.
4.  **The Bruise:** Place 1 fresh basil leaf in each chilled glass. Use a spoon to gently press (bruise) the leaf against the glass.
5.  **Assemble:** To each glass, add 2 tbsp of the chilled syrup, 1/2 cup Prosecco, and a lime wedge.
6.  **Finish:** Stir once very gently to maintain the Texture of the bubbles. Serve immediately.
