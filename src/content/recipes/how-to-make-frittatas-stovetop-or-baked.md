## Chef's Note
The frittata is the ultimate "Speed" hero for using up **Modularity** components. The secret to a professional texture is **Structural Science** through **The 12:3 Aeration Ratio**: 12 eggs to 3 tablespoons of full-fat dairy ensures a custard-like "Bounce" that never turns rubbery. We use **The Edge-Set Pattern**: cook on the stovetop just until the perimeter is pale and firm, then transfer to a high-heat oven (425°F) to finish. This creates a "souffléd" rise and a moist, slightly jiggly center.

## Directions

1.  **Aeration:** In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, dairy, and salt until the yolks and whites are perfectly blended and slightly frothy. Fold in half the cheese.
2.  **Sauté:** Heat oil in a 12-inch cast-iron or oven-safe skillet over medium-high. Add your dense vegetables (onions, peppers) first, then softer ones (zucchini, greens). Sauté until tender-crisp.
3.  **The Edge-Set:** Pour the egg mixture over the vegetables. Use a spatula to distribute evenly. Let sit undisturbed for 1 minute until the very edge looks set and opaque.
4.  **The Rise:** Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top. Transfer the skillet to a **425°F oven**.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 7-10 minutes until the frittata is puffed and the center has a very slight wobble when shaken. **Do not over-bake.**
6.  **Finish:** Garnish with fresh herbs. Slice into wedges and serve immediately or at room temperature for the Gold Standard experience.
