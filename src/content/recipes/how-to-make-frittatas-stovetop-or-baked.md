## Chef's Note

Frittatas are Italian open-faced omelets perfect for using up vegetables and leftover ingredients—a thrifty tradition that dates back centuries. The ratio matters: 12 eggs to 3 tablespoons of cream creates a custardy texture that stays tender, not rubbery. Start on the stovetop to set the edges, then finish in a 425°F oven for a puffed, golden top with a slightly jiggly center.

## Directions

1.  **Aeration:** In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, dairy, and salt until the yolks and whites are perfectly blended and slightly frothy. Fold in half the cheese.
2.  **Sauté:** Heat oil in a 12-inch cast-iron or oven-safe skillet over medium-high. Add your dense vegetables (onions, peppers) first, then softer ones (zucchini, greens). Sauté until tender-crisp.
3.  **The Edge-Set:** Pour the egg mixture over the vegetables. Use a spatula to distribute evenly. Let sit undisturbed for 1 minute until the very edge looks set and opaque.
4.  **The Rise:** Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top. Transfer the skillet to a **425°F oven**.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 7-10 minutes until the frittata is puffed and the center has a very slight wobble when shaken. **Do not over-bake.**
6.  **Finish:** Garnish with fresh herbs. Slice into wedges and serve immediately or at room temperature for the Kitchen Standard experience.
