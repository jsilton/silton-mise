## Chef's Note

This is a masterclass in **Modularity**. The secret to the Silton Standard is **The Miso-Grapefruit Lacquer Pattern**: we use grapefruit juice instead of the traditional lemon to provide a more sophisticated, floral **Acid Finish**. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The 5-Minute Broil**: by spreading the thick lacquer over the salmon and placing it 5 inches from the broiler, we create a mahogany "Snap" on the surface while keeping the center a succulent medium-rare "Bounce." The 10-minute **Steam Cycle** for the rice is mandatory for structure.

## Directions

1.  **The Rice:** Rinse sushi rice 3 times. Combine with 2 1/4 cups water in a pot. Boil, then reduce to lowest setting and simmer, covered, for 18 minutes. **Do not lift the lid.**
2.  **The Steam:** Remove rice from heat. Let stand, covered, for 10 minutes. Fold in scallions and 1 tbsp butter.
3.  **The Lacquer:** In a small bowl, whisk miso, honey, oil, ginger, and grapefruit zest/juice until a thick paste forms.
4.  **The Sear:** Arrange salmon on a foil-lined tray. Spread the miso lacquer heavily over each fillet.
5.  **Broil:** Place under a high broiler for 5-7 minutes until the surface is charred and bubbling.
6.  **Assemble:** Mound the scallion rice in 4 bowls. Top with a salmon fillet.
7.  **Finish:** Layer with cucumber, avocado, kimchi, and a dollop of chile crisp for the mandatory **High Note**.
