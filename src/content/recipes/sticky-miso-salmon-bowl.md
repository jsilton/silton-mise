## Chef's Note

This Japanese-inspired bowl uses grapefruit juice instead of traditional lemon in the miso glaze for more sophisticated, floral acidity. Spreading thick miso-honey-grapefruit lacquer over salmon and broiling 5-7 minutes creates a charred, caramelized surface while keeping the center medium-rare and tender. Letting sushi rice rest covered for 10 minutes after cooking allows steam to finish cooking and ensures fluffy, separate grains.

## Directions

1.  **The Rice:** Rinse sushi rice 3 times. Combine with 2 1/4 cups water in a pot. Boil, then reduce to lowest setting and simmer, covered, for 18 minutes. **Do not lift the lid.**
2.  **The Steam:** Remove rice from heat. Let stand, covered, for 10 minutes. Fold in scallions and 1 tbsp butter.
3.  **The Lacquer:** In a small bowl, whisk miso, honey, oil, ginger, and grapefruit zest/juice until a thick paste forms.
4.  **The Sear:** Arrange salmon on a foil-lined tray. Spread the miso lacquer heavily over each fillet.
5.  **Broil:** Place under a high broiler for 5-7 minutes until the surface is charred and bubbling.
6.  **Assemble:** Mound the scallion rice in 4 bowls. Top with a salmon fillet.
7.  **Finish:** Layer with cucumber, avocado, kimchi, and a dollop of chile crisp for the mandatory **High Note**.
