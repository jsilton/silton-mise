## Chef's Note
This is the baseline for 15-minute "Speed" cooking. The secret to avoiding dry, tough chicken is **Texture Integrity** through the **Butterfly and Bone-Dry Patterns**. You must use thin-cut breasts or butterfly them yourself to ensure the meat cooks in exactly 8 minutes. Before dredging, pat the chicken with paper towels until it is **bone-dry**—this ensures the flour creates a shatteringly crisp "Snap" on the surface rather than a gummy paste.

## Directions

1.  **Dry:** Pat chicken breasts dry with paper towels. If they are thick, butterfly them horizontally to create 8 thin cutlets.
2.  **Dredge:** In a wide bowl, whisk together flour, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and Italian seasoning.
3.  **Coat:** Using tongs, coat each piece of chicken in the flour mixture, shaking off the excess until only a translucent film remains.
4.  **Sear:** Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Place chicken in the pan (do not crowd).
5.  **Cook:** Sear for 4-5 minutes per side until deep golden brown and the internal temp is 165°F. Flip only once to maintain the crust.
6.  **Serve:** Let rest for 2 minutes before serving to preserve the juices.
