## Directions

1. To a large Dutch oven set over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and enough chorizo to cover the bottom of the pan without overcrowding. Cook, turning once, until crisped on both sides, 5–7 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate, then repeat with any remaining chorizo and set aside. Discard any accumulated fat and return the pot to the stove.
2. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400ºF. To the empty pot, add the remaining olive oil, garlic, onions, and bell pepper and turn the heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is jammy and browned, about 20 minutes (do not rush this step). Stir in the red pepper paste and tomato paste and cook for 5 minutes more. Add the sherry, bring to a boil, then add the stock, cinnamon, saffron, chickpeas, raisins, reserved chorizo, and salt to taste and return to a boil.
3. Add the rice, bring to a boil again, then bake, uncovered, until the rice is al dente and the liquid is absorbed, 20–25 minutes. Remove from the oven, cover, and let stand until the rice is just tender, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with the chives and serve hot or warm.
