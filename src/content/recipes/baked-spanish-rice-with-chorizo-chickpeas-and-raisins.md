## Chef's Note

This is a one-pot masterpiece that utilizes **Flavor Layering**. We start by rendering the fat from the cured **Chorizo**; this spicy, red oil becomes the cooking medium for the vegetables and the rice. The result is a deeply savory, aromatic dish where every grain of rice is infused with smoke and spice. The raisins provide the vital sweet contrast to the salty pork and earthy chickpeas.

## Directions

1.  **Render:** In a large oven-safe skillet or Dutch oven, cook the chorizo rounds over medium heat until they are crispy and have released their red oil. Remove chorizo to a plate.
2.  **Sauté:** Add the onion, bell pepper, and garlic to the chorizo fat. Cook for 8-10 minutes until soft and "jammy."
3.  **The Bloom:** Stir in the tomato paste, smoked paprika, and saffron. Fry for 1 minute until fragrant.
4.  **Toast:** Add the dry rice to the pan. Stir for 2 minutes to coat every grain in the spiced oil.
5.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the sherry, scraping the bottom of the pan. Let it bubble for 1 minute.
6.  **Simmer:** Add the broth, chickpeas, raisins, and the reserved chorizo. Bring to a boil.
7.  **Bake:** Cover tightly and transfer to a 400°F oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.
8.  **Rest:** Remove from oven and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes. This is the secret to fluffy, distinct grains.
