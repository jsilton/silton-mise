## Chef's Note

The Dutch Baby is a masterclass in **Structural Science**. The secret to the massive, billowing rise is the **Thermal Jump Pattern**: you must place the cold batter (mixed in a blender for maximum aeration) into a preheated, screaming-hot cast-iron skillet filled with sizzling butter. This sudden temperature shock causes the steam to expand rapidly, creating the signature high-walled "Bounce" that defines the dish. Always use **The Blender Pattern** to ensure the flour is fully hydrated and the eggs are perfectly aerated.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Place a 10-inch or 12-inch cast-iron skillet inside as it heats.
2.  **The Batter:** In a blender, combine eggs, milk, flour, vanilla, and salt. Blend on high for 30-45 seconds until completely smooth and frothy.
3.  **The Jump:** Once the oven is ready, carefully remove the hot skillet. Add the 4 tbsp butter and swirl until melted and foaming.
4.  **Pour:** Immediately pour the batter directly into the center of the sizzling butter. Do not stir.
5.  **Bake:** Transfer to the oven. Bake for 20 minutes until the pancake is puffed, deep golden brown, and climbing the sides of the pan. **Do not open the oven door** during the first 15 minutes!
6.  **Finish:** Remove from the oven. The center will collapse slightly—this is mandatory.
7.  **Serve:** Dust with powdered sugar and squeeze fresh lemon juice over the top for the mandatory **High Note**.
