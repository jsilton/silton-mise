3. Pour batter into the baking dish with the melted butter. Bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown and puffy
4. Remove from oven and sprinkle generously with syrup and powdered sugar or fresh lemon juice and powdered sugar.

## Notes

To keep German Pancakes from sticking to the pan, make sure you let the butter completely melt in the pan before pouring the batter in.If you want to have more peaks in your pancakes, try swirling the batter when you pour so it mixes more with the butter! If you pour directly into the middle then the butter will push to the sides and that is where you will get your raised peaks!I always prepare my batter in a blender! It's so much quicker and easier to wash than a mixing bowl and it combines the batter better as well!
