## Chef's Note

This German-American pancake gets its dramatic rise from temperature contrast: cold blended batter poured into a screaming-hot cast-iron skillet with sizzling butter. The sudden heat causes steam to expand rapidly, creating signature high walls. Blending aerates eggs and fully hydrates flour for the fluffiest texture. Fresh lemon juice adds brightness.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Place a 10-inch or 12-inch cast-iron skillet inside as it heats.
2.  **The Batter:** In a blender, combine eggs, milk, flour, vanilla, and salt. Blend on high for 30-45 seconds until completely smooth and frothy.
3.  **The Jump:** Once the oven is ready, carefully remove the hot skillet. Add the 4 tbsp butter and swirl until melted and foaming.
4.  **Pour:** Immediately pour the batter directly into the center of the sizzling butter. Do not stir.
5.  **Bake:** Transfer to the oven. Bake for 20 minutes until the pancake is puffed, deep golden brown, and climbing the sides of the pan. **Do not open the oven door** during the first 15 minutes!
6.  **Finish:** Remove from the oven. The center will collapse slightly—this is mandatory.
7.  **Serve:** Dust with powdered sugar and squeeze fresh lemon juice over the top for the mandatory **High Note**.
