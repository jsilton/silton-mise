## Chef's Note
This is a baseline **Modularity** component for seasonal wellness. The secret to the Silton Standard is the **Reduction Cycle Pattern**: we simmer the berries until the liquid has decreased by exactly half, concentrating the anthocyanins into a potent base. The most critical step is the **Honey Stabilization**: you must wait until the syrup is lukewarm before adding the honey. This preserves the natural enzymes and probiotics in the raw honey that would be destroyed by heat.

## Directions

1.  **Concentrate:** In a medium saucepan, combine water, elderberries, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves. 
2.  **Simmer:** Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer for 45-60 minutes until the liquid has reduced by half.
3.  **Mash:** Remove from heat. Use a flat utensil or potato masher to crush the berries, releasing any remaining juice.
4.  **Strain:** Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a clean glass jar. Press firmly on the solids. Discard the berries.
5.  **Stabilize:** Let the liquid cool until it is lukewarm (below 110°F). Stir in the raw honey until completely dissolved and integrated.
6.  **Store:** Seal the jar and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 months. 
7.  **Dose:** Standard Silton dose is 1 tsp daily for kids, 1 tbsp for adults.
