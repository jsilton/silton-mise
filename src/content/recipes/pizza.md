## Chef's Note

Pizza as we know it originated in Naples in the late 18th century as street food for the working class, but it didn't become an American phenomenon until Italian immigrants opened pizzerias in New York and New Haven in the early 1900s. What Americans call 'pizza' would be unrecognizable to Neapolitans - we top it with everything from pineapple to BBQ chicken, making it distinctly our own. The secret to crispy homemade pizza is preheating your pizza stone for a full 30 minutes at maximum temperature - this mimics the intense heat of commercial pizza ovens.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Preheat oven to 500°F (or higher). Place a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the middle rack.
2.  **Shape:** On a floured surface, stretch the dough into 12-inch circles. Transfer to a piece of parchment paper.
3.  **Layer:** Spread a thin layer of sauce over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Top generously with mozzarella.
4.  **Top:** Arrange the pepperoni and pineapple slices.
5.  **Bake:** Slide the pizza (with the parchment) onto the hot stone. Bake for 8-10 minutes until the crust is charred and the cheese is bubbling.
6.  **The Wilt:** During the final 2 minutes, scatter the fresh spinach over the top.
7.  **Serve:** Remove from the oven. Let rest for 2 minutes (The Finish Cycle) before slicing.
