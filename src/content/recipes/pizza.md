## Chef's Note
The secret to a "Gold Standard" home pizza is **Structural Science** through **The Thermal Stone Pattern**. You must preheat your oven (and pizza stone) to its maximum temperature (500°F+) for at least 30 minutes. This creates an immediate "Snap" on the bottom crust while the whole-milk mozzarella develops a blistered "Bounce." We maintain **Texture Integrity** by adding the spinach only during the final 2 minutes of baking to prevent it from turning into a wet clump. The pineapple provides the mandatory **Acid Finish** to cut through the salty pepperoni.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Preheat oven to 500°F (or higher). Place a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the middle rack.
2.  **Shape:** On a floured surface, stretch the dough into 12-inch circles. Transfer to a piece of parchment paper.
3.  **Layer:** Spread a thin layer of sauce over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Top generously with mozzarella.
4.  **Top:** Arrange the pepperoni and pineapple slices.
5.  **Bake:** Slide the pizza (with the parchment) onto the hot stone. Bake for 8-10 minutes until the crust is charred and the cheese is bubbling.
6.  **The Wilt:** During the final 2 minutes, scatter the fresh spinach over the top.
7.  **Serve:** Remove from the oven. Let rest for 2 minutes (The Set Cycle) before slicing.
