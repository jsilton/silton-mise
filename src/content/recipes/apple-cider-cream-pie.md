## Chef's Note

This pie concentrates two cups of unfiltered apple cider down to 1/2 cup syrup, intensifying its flavor tenfold. The apple cider vinegar in the crust inhibits gluten development, creating a tender, flaky pastry that contrasts beautifully with the rich custard filling. Cool completely before slicing - the custard needs several hours to set properly.

## Directions

1.  **The Crust:** In a food processor, pulse flour, cornstarch, sugar, and salt. Add butter and pulse until it looks like coarse meal. Drizzle in milk and vinegar; pulse until dough just forms. Pat into a disk, wrap in plastic, and chill for 30 minutes.
2.  **Blind Bake:** Roll dough to an 11-inch round and fit into a 9-inch pie plate. Crimp edges and chill until firm (15 mins). Preheat oven to 425°F. Line with parchment and weights; bake for 15 mins. Remove weights and parchment. Cover edges with foil and bake 15 mins more at 350°F until set but not browned.
3.  **The Reduction:** While the crust cools, boil the apple cider in a saucepan until reduced to 1/2 cup (about 10-12 mins). Let it cool completely.
4.  **The Custard:** Whisk the reduced cider with 3/4 cup sugar, sour cream, and salt. Whisk in the eggs until smooth.
5.  **Bake:** Pour custard into the cooled shell. Bake at 350°F for 35-40 minutes until the edges are set but the center is still slightly jiggly. Cool completely (this is mandatory for the set).
6.  **Finish:** Whip heavy cream with 1/4 cup sugar and cinnamon until firm peaks form. Mound over the cooled pie before serving.
