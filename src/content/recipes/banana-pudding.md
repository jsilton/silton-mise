## Chef's Note

We have moved away from the "Instant" box. Real banana pudding relies on a **Cooked Custard Base**. The secret is **Tempering the Eggs**: by slowly adding hot milk to the yolks, you ensure a silky, egg-free texture that instant pudding cannot replicate. The salt and butter at the end create a rich "High Note" finish that cuts through the sugar.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a saucepan, whisk 2.5 cups of milk, sugar, salt, and cornstarch. Bring to a simmer over medium heat until it starts to thicken.
2.  **Temper:** In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the remaining 1/2 cup cold milk. Slowly ladle 1 cup of the hot milk into the yolks while whisking constantly.
3.  **Thicken:** Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan. Cook over low heat for 3-5 minutes, stirring constantly, until it reaches a thick pudding consistency.
4.  **Finish Base:** Remove from heat. Stir in the butter and vanilla. Let cool slightly.
5.  **Layer:** In a glass bowl, layer: Wafers -> Sliced Bananas -> Warm Custard. Repeat until all ingredients are used.
6.  **Chill:** Cover with plastic wrap (press it directly onto the custard surface to prevent a skin). Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.
7.  **Serve:** Top with fresh whipped cream and crushed wafers just before serving.
