## Directions

1. Chinese Broccoli - trim ends, cut into 7.5cm/3" pieces. Separate leaves from stems. Cut thick stems in half vertically so they're no wider than 0.8cm / 0.3" thick.
2. Noodles - Prepare according to packet directions and drain. Time it so they're cooked just before using - do not leave cooked rice noodles lying around, they break in the wok.
3. Sauce - Mix ingredients until sugar dissolves.
4. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a very large heavy based skillet or wok over high heat.
5. Add garlic, cook 15 seconds. Add chicken, cook until it mostly changes from pink to white.
6. Add Chinese broccoli stems, cook until chicken is almost cooked through.
7. Add Chinese broccoli leaves, cook until just wilted.
8. Push everything to one side, crack egg in and scramble. Remove everything onto a plate (scrape wok clean).
9. Return wok to stove, heat 2 tbsp oil over high heat.
10. Add noodles and Sauce. Toss as few times as possible to disperse Sauce and make edges of noodles caramelise.
11. Quickly add chicken and veg back in, and toss to disperse. Serve immediately!
