## Chef's Note

Pad see ew is a Thai stir-fried noodle dish characterized by its dark color and slightly charred flavor. The key is searing fresh wide rice noodles undisturbed over highest heat for 30 seconds, allowing dark soy sauce to caramelize and scorch against the noodle - creating wok hei (breath of the wok). Chinese broccoli stems are added before leaves so they cook evenly.

## Directions

1.  **Prep Veg:** Cut Gai Lan into 3-inch pieces. Halve thick stems vertically.
2.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together both soy sauces, oyster sauce, sugar, and vinegar until sugar is dissolved.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok until smoking. Sear the chicken and Gai Lan stems for 2 minutes. Add the leaves and sauté until just wilted. Remove to a plate.
4.  **The Egg:** Add 1 tsp oil. Scramble the egg until just set. Remove and set aside.
5.  **The Scorch:** Add 2 tbsp oil to the smoking hot wok. Add the rice noodles. Let them sit **undisturbed for 30 seconds** until you smell the sear.
6.  **Bind:** Pour the sauce over the noodles. Toss vigorously for 1 minute until the noodles are dark and glossy.
7.  **Finish:** Return the chicken, veg, and egg to the wok. Toss for 30 seconds to integrate.
8.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with extra white pepper.
