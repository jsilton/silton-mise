## Chef's Note

The secret to a authentic Pad See Ew is **The Scorch Method**. To achieve the mandatory **Wok Hei** (breath of the wok), you must sear the rice noodles over the highest possible heat without moving them for 30 seconds; this allows the dark soy sauce to caramelize and "scorch" against the noodle, creating that smoky, slightly charred "Snap." We maintain **Textural Balance** by separating the Chinese broccoli leaves and stems, adding the stems first to ensure they are tender while the leaves stay vibrant green.

## Directions

1.  **Prep Veg:** Cut Gai Lan into 3-inch pieces. Halve thick stems vertically.
2.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together both soy sauces, oyster sauce, sugar, and vinegar until sugar is dissolved.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok until smoking. Sear the chicken and Gai Lan stems for 2 minutes. Add the leaves and sauté until just wilted. Remove to a plate.
4.  **The Egg:** Add 1 tsp oil. Scramble the egg until just set. Remove and set aside.
5.  **The Scorch:** Add 2 tbsp oil to the smoking hot wok. Add the rice noodles. Let them sit **undisturbed for 30 seconds** until you smell the sear.
6.  **Bind:** Pour the sauce over the noodles. Toss vigorously for 1 minute until the noodles are dark and glossy.
7.  **Finish:** Return the chicken, veg, and egg to the wok. Toss for 30 seconds to integrate.
8.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with extra white pepper.
