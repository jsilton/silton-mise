## Chef's Note

This Vietnamese dish uses coarsely ground black pepper as the primary flavor, not just a background seasoning. Sear chicken pieces until deeply browned before adding the glaze - this creates caramelized crust that stands up to the sweet-savory sauce. Fish sauce provides umami depth while rice vinegar adds brightness.

## Directions

1.  **Sear:** Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add the chicken in a single layer. Sear undisturbed for 3 minutes until a dark crust forms. Flip and cook for 2 more minutes. Remove to a plate.
2.  **Shallots:** Add the sliced shallots to the pan. Cook until softened and starting to brown (3 mins).
3.  **The Glaze:** Pour in the fish sauce, sugar, vinegar, ginger, garlic, pepper, and chilies. Simmer for 2 minutes until the sauce bubbles and turns into a thick, dark syrup.
4.  **Toss:** Return the chicken to the pan. Toss vigorously over high heat until the chicken is lacquered in the black pepper glaze.
5.  **Serve:** Garnish with cilantro. Serve over rice.
