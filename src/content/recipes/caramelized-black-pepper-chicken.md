## Chef's Note

This dish is about **Flavor Layering and Caramelization**. We use black pepper as a primary flavor driver, not just a seasoning. The secret is the **Hard Sear**: you want the chicken chunks to be browned and crispy before the sugar and fish sauce hit the pan. The fish sauce provides the umami depth, while the vinegar gives it the essential **Acid Balance**.

## Directions

1.  **Sear:** Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add the chicken in a single layer. Sear undisturbed for 3 minutes until a dark crust forms. Flip and cook for 2 more minutes. Remove to a plate.
2.  **Shallots:** Add the sliced shallots to the pan. Cook until softened and starting to brown (3 mins).
3.  **The Glaze:** Pour in the fish sauce, sugar, vinegar, ginger, garlic, pepper, and chilies. Simmer for 2 minutes until the sauce bubbles and turns into a thick, dark syrup.
4.  **Toss:** Return the chicken to the pan. Toss vigorously over high heat until the chicken is lacquered in the black pepper glaze.
5.  **Serve:** Garnish with cilantro. Serve over rice.
