## Chef's Note

The secret to spelt muffins that aren't dry is **Culinary Technique** through **The High-Hydration Method**. Spelt has a more fragile gluten structure than wheat; by using a full cup of pumpkin and 1/2 cup of honey, we create a moisture guard that results in a tender, cake-like "Bounce." We use **Pumpkin Pie Spice** as the mandatory aromatic **High Note**—it defines the autumnal profile. Do not over-mix once the flour is added, as the muffins will deflate and lose their vertical rise.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk together spelt flour, spices, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a medium bowl, whisk eggs, honey, and melted butter. Stir in the pumpkin puree until perfectly smooth and orange.
3.  **Combine:** Make a well in the dry ingredients. Pour in the pumpkin mix. Fold with a spatula until **just combined**.
4.  **Bake:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a 12-cup tin. Fill each cup 3/4 full. Bake for 18-20 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
5.  **Cool:** Let cool completely in the pan to allow the spelt structure to set into a Crunch tender crumb.
