## Chef's Note

This Lebanese garlic sauce requires patience - add oil in the thinnest possible stream, literally drop by drop for the first cup. This allows garlic's natural lecithin to bind oil and water into stable, fluffy foam. Rushing breaks the emulsion into oily soup. Lemon juice keeps garlic's heat in check while refrigeration mellows its bite.

## Directions

1.  **The Puree:** Place the garlic cloves and salt in a food processor. Pulse and scrape until the garlic is a completely smooth, uniform paste.
2.  **The First Emulsion:** With the motor running, slowly drizzle in 1/2 cup of the oil, drop by drop. The mixture should begin to look like a thick paste.
3.  **The Stabilizer:** Slowly drizzle in 1 tbsp of the lemon juice. The paste will turn noticeably whiter.
4.  **The Stream:** Continue the process—alternating between 1/2 cup of oil and 1 tsp of lemon juice—until all the oil and lemon are used. The stream can be slightly thicker now, but never rushed.
5.  **The Texture:** With the motor still running, slowly add the cold water. This will lighten the paste and give it its signature cloud-like fluffiness.
6.  **Set:** Transfer to a glass jar and refrigerate for at least 4 hours before using. This allows the garlic vapors to mellow and the emulsion to set.
7.  **Store:** Keeps in the fridge for up to 3 weeks.
