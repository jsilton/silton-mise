## Chef's Note

Toum is the ultimate test of **Culinary Technique** in the condiment category. The secret to its incredible Texture is the **Molecular Emulsion Method**: you must add the oil in the thinnest possible stream, literally drop by drop for the first cup. This allows the garlic's natural lecithin to bind the oil and water into a stable, fluffy foam that mimics egg whites. If you rush, the emulsion will "break" and turn into an oily soup. The lemon juice provides the mandatory **Acid Balance** that keeps the garlic's heat in check.

## Directions

1.  **The Puree:** Place the garlic cloves and salt in a food processor. Pulse and scrape until the garlic is a completely smooth, uniform paste.
2.  **The First Emulsion:** With the motor running, slowly drizzle in 1/2 cup of the oil, drop by drop. The mixture should begin to look like a thick paste.
3.  **The Stabilizer:** Slowly drizzle in 1 tbsp of the lemon juice. The paste will turn noticeably whiter.
4.  **The Stream:** Continue the process—alternating between 1/2 cup of oil and 1 tsp of lemon juice—until all the oil and lemon are used. The stream can be slightly thicker now, but never rushed.
5.  **The Texture:** With the motor still running, slowly add the cold water. This will lighten the paste and give it its signature cloud-like fluffiness.
6.  **Set:** Transfer to a glass jar and refrigerate for at least 4 hours before using. This allows the garlic vapors to mellow and the emulsion to set.
7.  **Store:** Keeps in the fridge for up to 3 weeks.
