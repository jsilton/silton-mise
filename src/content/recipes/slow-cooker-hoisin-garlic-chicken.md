## Chef's Note

This slow-cooker hoisin chicken uses a simple reduction technique: after cooking the chicken in the sauce, the remaining liquid is boiled separately in a saucepan until it becomes a thick, glossy glaze. This ensures tender, succulent chicken while creating a concentrated sauce. Balsamic vinegar cuts through hoisin's fermented sweetness.

## Directions

1.  **Slow Cook:** In a 6-quart slow cooker, combine chicken thighs, hoisin, garlic, tomato paste, vinegar, and spices. **Cook on High for 2 hours**.
2.  **The Pull:** Using tongs, remove the chicken to a large platter. Use two forks to shred into large, chunky pieces.
3.  **The Glaze:** Pour all the liquid from the slow cooker into a small saucepan. Bring to a vigorous boil over high heat. Cook for 10-12 minutes until reduced by half and syrupy.
4.  **Bind:** Pour the reduced glaze over the shredded chicken. Toss until every strand is lacquered.
5.  **Serve:** Garnish with scallions and serve immediately over rice or in lettuce wraps.
