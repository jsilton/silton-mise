## Directions

1. Combine the chicken, hoisin sauce, chopped garlic, tomato paste, vinegar, garlic powder, crushed red pepper and 2 teaspoons salt in a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker. Cook on high for about 2 hours. (The dish holds well on warm for several hours for flexibility in timing.)
2. Using tongs, remove the chicken to a large, rimmed serving plate or bowl.
3. Pour the sauce into a small saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil and cook at a vigorous simmer until reduced and syrupy, 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, using two forks, coarsely pull apart and shred the chicken. Pour the reduced sauce over the chicken and toss to coat. Taste and add more salt, red pepper or vinegar if necessary. Top with scallions, if desired.
