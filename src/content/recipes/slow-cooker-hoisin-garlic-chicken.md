## Chef's Note
This is a masterclass in **Modularity**. The secret to its Success is **The Double-Reduction Pattern**: we cook the chicken in the hoisin-balsamic base, then remove the meat and boil the remaining liquid in a separate saucepan until it becomes a thick, mirror-glossy glaze. This ensures the chicken has a succulent "Bounce" while the sauce provides a deep, savory "Snap." The balsamic vinegar is the mandatory **Acid Finish** that cuts through the fermented sweetness of the hoisin.

## Directions

1.  **Slow Cook:** In a 6-quart slow cooker, combine chicken thighs, hoisin, garlic, tomato paste, vinegar, and spices. **Cook on High for 2 hours**.
2.  **The Pull:** Using tongs, remove the chicken to a large platter. Use two forks to shred into large, chunky pieces.
3.  **The Glaze:** Pour all the liquid from the slow cooker into a small saucepan. Bring to a vigorous boil over high heat. Cook for 10-12 minutes until reduced by half and syrupy.
4.  **Bind:** Pour the reduced glaze over the shredded chicken. Toss until every strand is lacquered.
5.  **Serve:** Garnish with scallions and serve immediately over rice or in lettuce wraps.
