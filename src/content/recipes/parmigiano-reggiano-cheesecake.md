## Chef's Note

This is a sophisticated, "Restaurant Style" cheesecake that plays with the boundary between savory and sweet. The key is the **Water Bath (Bain-Marie)**: it provides gentle, even heat that prevents the top from cracking and ensures a creamy, custardy texture rather than a grainy one. The inclusion of real Parmigiano Reggiano adds a complex, salty umami that makes this the most interesting dessert in your library.

## Directions

1.  **The Crust:** Pulse the cheese, crackers, and seeds in a food processor. Mix with butter and press into a 10-inch springform pan. Bake at 350°F for 15 minutes. Cool.
2.  **The Filling:** Cream the cream cheese and sugar until silky. Add the sour cream, vanilla, and grated Parmigiano.
3.  **Eggs:** Add eggs **one at a time**, mixing on low speed to avoid aerating the batter (bubbles cause cracks!).
4.  **The Seal:** Wrap the bottom of the pan in heavy-duty foil. Place in a large roasting pan.
5.  **The Bath:** Pour the batter into the crust. Pour hot water into the roasting pan until it reaches halfway up the side of the springform pan.
6.  **Bake:** Bake at 325°F for 85-90 minutes until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle.
7.  **The Chill:** Turn off the oven, crack the door, and let it sit for 1 hour. Then refrigerate for at least 6 hours.
