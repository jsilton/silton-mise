## Chef's Note

Egg roll in a bowl is a deconstructed version of the classic takeout item—all the filling without the wrapper, making it low-carb and quick. The key is cooking the pork first until crispy, then adding the cabbage at the very end. You want it just wilted but still slightly crisp—overcooking turns it mushy. Chili crisp and sesame seeds add finishing flavor and texture.

## Directions

1.  **Protein:** Heat a large skillet or wok over high heat. Add the ground meat and cook, breaking it up, until browned and crispy at the edges.
2.  **Aromatics:** Stir in the ginger and garlic. Cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.
3.  **the crunch:** Add the entire bag of coleslaw mix. Pour in the soy sauce and sesame oil.
4.  **Toss:** Stir-fry vigorously for 2-3 minutes. **Stop immediately** when the cabbage starts to collapse but still feels firm.
5.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Top with green onions, sesame seeds, and a generous drizzle of chili crisp.
