## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate low-carb "Survival" meal. The secret to **Texture Integrity** is the cabbage: you must stir-fry the pork first until crispy, and only add the cabbage at the very end. You want the cabbage to be "wilted-crisp"—it should soften slightly but still have a satisfying snap. If you overcook it, the dish turns into a mushy stir-fry.

## Directions

1.  **Protein:** Heat a large skillet or wok over high heat. Add the ground meat and cook, breaking it up, until browned and crispy at the edges.
2.  **Aromatics:** Stir in the ginger and garlic. Cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.
3.  **The Crunch:** Add the entire bag of coleslaw mix. Pour in the soy sauce and sesame oil.
4.  **Toss:** Stir-fry vigorously for 2-3 minutes. **Stop immediately** when the cabbage starts to collapse but still feels firm.
5.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Top with green onions, sesame seeds, and a generous drizzle of chili crisp.
