## Chef's Note

This slow-cooker adaptation of Thai-style coconut curry keeps flavors from becoming flat by whisking spices directly into coconut milk and tomato paste before cooking, ensuring even distribution of fat-soluble aromatics. Fresh mango served alongside adds bright, sweet-tart contrast to the rich, earthy coconut base - a common Thai practice of balancing flavors.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** Place the diced onion, carrots, garlic, and bell peppers in the bottom of the slow cooker.
2.  **The Mix:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, tomato paste, curry powder, garam masala, and salt until smooth.
3.  **Assemble:** Place the cubed chicken on top of the vegetables. Pour the coconut curry sauce over everything.
4.  **Cook:** Cover and cook on **HIGH for 3-4 hours** or **LOW for 5-6 hours** until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is fully cooked.
5.  **The Finish:** Stir the curry once before serving to incorporate the rendered juices.
6.  **Serve:** Serve in deep bowls over cooked brown rice. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve with mango slices on the side.
