## Chef's Note
The danger of slow-cooker curries is "flat" flavor and mushy meat. We solve this with **Texture Integrity** and **The Bloom Pattern**. We whisk the spices directly into the coconut milk and tomato paste before adding to the pot; this ensures the fat-soluble spices are fully distributed. The inclusion of **Fresh Mango** on the side isn't just a garnish—it's the mandatory **Acid Finish** that provides a bright "High Note" to cut through the rich, earthy coconut base.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** Place the diced onion, carrots, garlic, and bell peppers in the bottom of the slow cooker.
2.  **The Mix:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, tomato paste, curry powder, garam masala, and salt until smooth.
3.  **Assemble:** Place the cubed chicken on top of the vegetables. Pour the coconut curry sauce over everything.
4.  **Cook:** Cover and cook on **HIGH for 3-4 hours** or **LOW for 5-6 hours** until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is fully cooked.
5.  **The Finish:** Stir the curry once before serving to incorporate the rendered juices.
6.  **Serve:** Serve in deep bowls over cooked brown rice. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve with mango slices on the side.
