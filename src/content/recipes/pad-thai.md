## Chef's Note

In the 1930s, Thai Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram launched a cultural campaign to create a unified national identity, which included promoting a 'national dish.' Pad Thai was born from this movement - a street food that used local ingredients and represented Thai cuisine to the world. The name literally means 'Thai-style stir-fried noodles,' and by the 1960s it had become Thailand's most recognizable dish internationally, despite being less than a century old. Real tamarind paste (sold in blocks, not concentrate) gives it the distinctive tangy-funky flavor that separates authentic Pad Thai from overly-sweet takeout versions.

## Directions

1.  **The Soak:** Place dry noodles in a large bowl of cool water. Soak for 40 minutes until flexible but still firm. Drain.
2.  **The Crunch:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok. Fry peanuts until golden; remove. Fry tofu matchsticks until golden and firm; remove.
3.  **Aromatics:** Heat 1 tbsp oil. Sauté garlic and shallots until fragrant. Add the drained noodles and the tamarind mixture (sugar, fish sauce, chili).
4.  **Toss:** Stir-fry over high heat. If the noodles feel too firm, add 1 tbsp of water at a time until they are chewy and translucent.
5.  **The Egg:** Push noodles to the side. Scramble the egg until set, then fold into the noodles.
6.  **Combine:** Add the shrimp and cooked tofu. Toss for 2 minutes until shrimp are pink and just opaque.
7.  **Finish:** Fold in the bean sprouts and chives. Toss for 15 seconds.
8.  **Serve:** Mound on a plate. Top with crushed peanuts, extra sprouts, and a lime wedge.
