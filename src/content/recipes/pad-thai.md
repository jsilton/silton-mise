## Chef's Note
Pad Thai is a masterclass in the **Acid-Salt-Sweet balance**. The secret to "Gold Standard" noodles is **The Cold Soak Pattern**: you must soak the rice noodles in room-temperature water for 40 minutes rather than boiling them. This ensures they maintain a resilient "Bounce" and absorb the **Tamarind Emulsion** without becoming mushy. The tamarind provides the mandatory **Acid Finish** that defines the dish. Always add the bean sprouts at the very end to ensure a fresh, watery "Snap" that contrasts the chewy noodles.

## Directions

1.  **The Soak:** Place dry noodles in a large bowl of cool water. Soak for 40 minutes until flexible but still firm. Drain.
2.  **The Snap:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok. Fry peanuts until golden; remove. Fry tofu matchsticks until golden and firm; remove.
3.  **Aromatics:** Heat 1 tbsp oil. Sauté garlic and shallots until fragrant. Add the drained noodles and the tamarind mixture (sugar, fish sauce, chili).
4.  **Toss:** Stir-fry over high heat. If the noodles feel too firm, add 1 tbsp of water at a time until they are chewy and translucent.
5.  **The Egg:** Push noodles to the side. Scramble the egg until set, then fold into the noodles.
6.  **Combine:** Add the shrimp and cooked tofu. Toss for 2 minutes until shrimp are pink and just opaque (The Shrimp Snap).
7.  **Finish:** Fold in the bean sprouts and chives. Toss for 15 seconds.
8.  **Serve:** Mound on a plate. Top with crushed peanuts, extra sprouts, and a lime wedge for the final **High Note**.
