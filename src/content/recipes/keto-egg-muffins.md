## Chef's Note
These are the ultimate high-speed "Fuel" for a low-carb week. The secret to avoiding the rubbery "sponginess" of many egg muffins is **Texture Integrity** through **The Charred Meat Base Pattern**: we place the raw chorizo at the bottom of the tin so it renders its spicy fat directly into the egg, creating a crispy "Snap" finish on the bottom. We use **The Pesto Emulsion**: whisking the oily pesto directly into the eggs ensures every bite has a savory "High Note" that cuts through the richness of the yolk.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Generously grease a 12-cup muffin tin with butter (do not use paper liners, as the eggs will stick).
2.  **The Base:** Divide the diced chorizo and scallions evenly among the 12 muffin cups.
3.  **Aeration:** In a large bowl, whisk the eggs with the pesto, salt, and pepper until very frothy and well-integrated.
4.  **Fold:** Stir in 3/4 of the shredded cheese.
5.  **Fill:** Pour the egg mixture into the muffin cups, filling each about 3/4 full. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the tops for a golden "Bounce."
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 15-20 minutes until the centers are set and the tops are slightly golden.
7.  **Serve:** Let cool for 5 minutes before popping them out with a knife.
