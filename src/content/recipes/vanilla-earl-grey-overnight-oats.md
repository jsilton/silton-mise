title: Vanilla Earl Grey Overnight Oats
prepTime: 10 min
totalTime: 370 min
servings: 'Yield: 2'
ingredients:
  - 1 Earl Grey tea bag
  - 1 cup hot boiling water
  - 1 tbsp pure honey
  - 2 cups uncooked old fashioned rolled oats (or quick oats) *see first note
  - ½ cup almond milk (or milk of your choice)
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract
  - cookie or wafer (I used a stroopwafel)

## Directions

1. In a medium bowl, steep the Earl Grey tea bag in the hot boiling water for 3-5 minutes (depending on how strong you like your tea). Discard the tea bag and stir in the honey until it completely dissolves.
2. Then add the oats, milk, and vanilla extract into the bowl. Whisk together until well-combined.
3. Carefully spoon into two (half pint) mason jars (or airtight containers). Seal the jars with lids and place in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or overnight.
4. After the oats are ready, open the jars then give the oats a stir and taste. Add additional milk if you prefer a thinner consistency and/or more honey for a sweeter flavour.
5. Finish by topping the overnight oats with a cookie or wafer if you like. Enjoy!

## Notes

I used quick oats (aka instant oats). These oats produce a softer and creamier texture than old-fashioned rolled oats. If you prefer a chewier texture that holds together better (it’s also the usual overnight oats choice), go with old-fashioned rolled oats.
