## Chef's Note

This is an energizing breakfast that uses a smart infusion technique. By steeping the oats in a concentrated Earl Grey base _before_ the milk, we ensure the bergamot oils penetrate the grains deeply. This results in a flavor that is fragrant and complex rather than just sweet. Overnight hydration (at least 6 hours) is essential to ensure the oats are chewy to the bite (al dente). The Stroopwafel provides the final textural contrast.

## Directions

1.  **The Infusion:** Steep the Earl Grey bag in 1 cup boiling water for 5 minutes. Discard the bag. Stir in the honey while hot until dissolved.
2.  **Emulsify:** Whisk in the milk, vanilla, and sea salt.
3.  **Combine:** Place the oats in a large bowl. Pour the tea-milk mixture over the top. Stir vigorously until the oats are fully submerged.
4.  **The Finish:** Divide into two half-pint mason jars. Cover and **refrigerate for at least 6 hours** (ideally 12).
5.  **Adjust:** Open the jar. If the oats are too thick, stir in a splash of fresh milk to reach a velvety "Bounce."
6.  **Serve:** Top with a crumbled Stroopwafel or wafer for the mandatory **High Note**.
