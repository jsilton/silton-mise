## Chef's Note
This is a high-performance **Fuel** breakfast that utilizes **Structural Science** through **The Botanical Infusion Pattern**. By steeping the oats in a concentrated Earl Grey base *before* the milk, we ensure the bergamot essential oils penetrate the starch cells of the grain. This results in a "Bounce" that is fragrant and complex rather than just sweet. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The 6-Hour Set**: overnight hydration is mandatory to ensure the oats are "squeaky" to the bite (al dente). The Stroopwafel provides the final mandatory **Textural Snap**.

## Directions

1.  **The Infusion:** Steep the Earl Grey bag in 1 cup boiling water for 5 minutes. Discard the bag. Stir in the honey while hot until dissolved.
2.  **Emulsify:** Whisk in the milk, vanilla, and sea salt. 
3.  **Combine:** Place the oats in a large bowl. Pour the tea-milk mixture over the top. Stir vigorously until the oats are fully submerged.
4.  **The Set:** Divide into two half-pint mason jars. Cover and **refrigerate for at least 6 hours** (ideally 12).
5.  **Adjust:** Open the jar. If the oats are too thick, stir in a splash of fresh milk to reach a velvety "Bounce."
6.  **Serve:** Top with a crumbled Stroopwafel or wafer for the mandatory **High Note**.
