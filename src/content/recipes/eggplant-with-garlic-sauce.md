## Chef's Note

Chinese eggplant with garlic sauce is a Sichuan/Hunan classic that's incredibly fast. Stir-fry the eggplant sticks alone over medium-high heat until the flesh turns deep golden and the skin is purple-gold—this develops smoky sweetness that boiling or steaming can't achieve. Chinkiang black vinegar adds the signature malty, complex acidity that balances the rich peanut oil and savory garlic. Chinese eggplants (long, thin ones) work best.

## Directions

1.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, sugar, black vinegar, Shaoxing wine, and sesame oil.
2.  **The Sear:** Heat 1 tbsp peanut oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high. Add eggplant. Stir-fry for 5 minutes until the edges are golden and the center is soft but holds its shape. Remove to a plate.
3.  **Aromatics:** Add the remaining 1 tbsp oil to the pan. Add garlic, ginger, and dried chilies. Sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.
4.  **Glaze:** Add the eggplant and scallions back to the pan. Pour the sauce over the vegetables.
5.  **Bind:** Toss vigorously for 1 minute until every piece of eggplant is coated in a glossy, thick glaze.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately over steamed rice.
