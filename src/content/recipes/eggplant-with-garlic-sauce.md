## Chef's Note

This is a 15-minute quick masterclass. The secret to the Kitchen Standard is **Textural Balance** through the **Golden-Side Method**: stir-fry the eggplant alone until the white flesh turns a deep golden brown and the skin is purple-gold—this creates a smoky sweetness that boiling or steaming misses. The mandatory **Acid Balance** comes from **Chinkiang Vinegar**; its deep, malty acidity provides the "High Note" that balances the richness of the peanut oil and the savory garlic.

## Directions

1.  **The Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, sugar, black vinegar, Shaoxing wine, and sesame oil.
2.  **The Sear:** Heat 1 tbsp peanut oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high. Add eggplant. Stir-fry for 5 minutes until the edges are golden and the center is soft but holds its shape. Remove to a plate.
3.  **Aromatics:** Add the remaining 1 tbsp oil to the pan. Add garlic, ginger, and dried chilies. Sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.
4.  **Glaze:** Add the eggplant and scallions back to the pan. Pour the sauce over the vegetables.
5.  **Bind:** Toss vigorously for 1 minute until every piece of eggplant is coated in a glossy, thick glaze.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately over steamed rice.
