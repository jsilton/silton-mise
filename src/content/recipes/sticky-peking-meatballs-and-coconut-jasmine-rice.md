## Chef's Note

This quick Chinese-American style dinner uses frozen meatballs glazed in hoisin and Peking duck sauce for a sticky, sweet coating reminiscent of takeout favorites. Jasmine rice cooked directly in coconut milk instead of water creates a rich, creamy base. Frozen meatballs seared from frozen develop a crispy exterior before heating through.

## Directions

1.  **The Rice:** Rinse jasmine rice until water is clear. In a rice cooker (or pot), combine rice, the full can of coconut milk, and 1/2 cup water. Cook until fluffy.
2.  **The Crunch:** Heat 1 tsp oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add frozen meatballs. Sauté for 8-10 minutes, tossing frequently, until charred and thawed.
3.  **The Glaze:** Add ginger and garlic to the meatballs; sauté for 30 seconds. Pour in the hoisin, duck sauce, and vinegar. Simmer for 5 minutes until the sauce is a thick, mirror-glossy lacquer.
4.  **The Veg:** In a second skillet, sauté carrots for 2 minutes. Add kale and garlic. Toss for 3 minutes until bright green. Finish with lemon juice and black pepper.
5.  **Serve:** Mound coconut rice in bowls. Top with 5 meatballs and a pile of "Acid" kale.
