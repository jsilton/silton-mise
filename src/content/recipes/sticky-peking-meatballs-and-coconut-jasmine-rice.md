## Chef's Note

Peking duck sauce, originally created to accompany Beijing's famous lacquered duck, became a Chinese-American pantry staple in the 1970s when bottled versions appeared alongside duck sauce and plum sauce. It's sweeter and more complex than standard hoisin, with hints of five-spice and fruit. Using frozen meatballs seared from frozen creates a caramelized crust that holds up to the sticky glaze without becoming mushy.

## Directions

1.  **The Rice:** Rinse jasmine rice until water runs clear. In a rice cooker, combine rice, the full can of coconut milk, and 1 cup water. Cook on white rice setting. (If using a pot: bring to a boil, reduce to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes off heat.)
2.  **The Crunch:** Heat 1 tsp oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add frozen meatballs without crowding. Sauté for 8-10 minutes, tossing frequently, until charred on multiple sides and heated through.
3.  **The Glaze:** Add ginger and 3 cloves minced garlic to the meatballs; sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant. Pour in the hoisin, duck sauce, and vinegar. Simmer for 5 minutes, tossing occasionally, until the sauce reduces to a thick, sticky glaze that coats the meatballs.
4.  **The Veg:** In a second skillet, heat 1 tsp oil over medium-high. Add carrots and sauté for 3 minutes until slightly softened. Add remaining 3 cloves minced garlic and kale. Add 1/4 cup water, cover, and steam for 2-3 minutes until kale is tender but still bright green. Uncover, toss until water evaporates. Finish with lemon juice, salt, and black pepper to taste.
5.  **Serve:** Fluff coconut rice and mound in bowls. Top each with 4-5 meatballs and a generous portion of garlicky kale and carrots. Garnish with sesame seeds and scallions if desired.
