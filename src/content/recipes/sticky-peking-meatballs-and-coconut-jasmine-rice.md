## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate high-speed **Modularity** hack for busy weeknights. The secret to its Success is **The Coconut Emulsion Method**: we cook jasmine rice directly in full-fat coconut milk; the fat provides a velvety Texture that standard water-boiled rice lacks. We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Frozen Sear**: we fry the meatballs while still frozen on high heat—this ensures a dark, crispy Maillard crust before the interior becomes too soft. The lemon juice over the kale provides the mandatory **Acid Balance**.

## Directions

1.  **The Rice:** Rinse jasmine rice until water is clear. In a rice cooker (or pot), combine rice, the full can of coconut milk, and 1/2 cup water. Cook until fluffy.
2.  **The Crunch:** Heat 1 tsp oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add frozen meatballs. Sauté for 8-10 minutes, tossing frequently, until charred and thawed.
3.  **The Glaze:** Add ginger and garlic to the meatballs; sauté for 30 seconds. Pour in the hoisin, duck sauce, and vinegar. Simmer for 5 minutes until the sauce is a thick, mirror-glossy lacquer.
4.  **The Veg:** In a second skillet, sauté carrots for 2 minutes. Add kale and garlic. Toss for 3 minutes until bright green. Finish with lemon juice and black pepper.
5.  **Serve:** Mound coconut rice in bowls. Top with 5 meatballs and a pile of "Acid" kale.
