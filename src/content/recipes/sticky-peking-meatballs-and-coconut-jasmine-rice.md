## Directions

1. Start Rice (Rice Cooker): Rinse the jasmine rice in a mesh strainer until water runs clear.1 Add to the rice cooker. Pour in the full can of coconut milk and the 1/2 cup of water. Do not add salt. Stir once and hit "Cook."
2. Sear Meatballs: Heat 1 tsp oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the frozen meatballs. Sauté for 8–10 minutes, tossing frequently, until they are thawed and have a nice dark brown crust.
3. Simmer Glaze: Turn heat down to medium. Add the extra ginger and minced garlic to the pan; stir for 30 seconds. Pour in the Hoisin, Peking Duck sauce, Rice Vinegar, and Water. Stir to coat. Simmer for 5–7 minutes until the sauce glazes the meat.
4. Cook Veg: While meatballs simmer, heat a splash of oil in a second skillet. Add carrots and cook for 2 minutes. Add the kale and sliced garlic. Toss for 3–4 minutes until kale is bright green. Season with Black Pepper and finish with the Lemon Juice (acid creates flavor "pop" without sodium).
5. Serve: Scoop coconut rice into bowls. Top with 5 meatballs per person and serve greens on the side.

## Notes

Rice Liquid: The mixture of coconut milk and coconut water ensures the rice is fragrant but not too heavy/sticky.Ginger: Do not skip the fresh ginger. It bridges the flavor gap between the Italian-seasoned meatballs and the Asian sauce.Leftovers: If you have leftover rice, it makes incredible fried rice the next day.
