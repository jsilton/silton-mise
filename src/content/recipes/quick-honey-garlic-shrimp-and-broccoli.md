## Chef's Note

This is the baseline for 15-minute "Fuel." The secret to its Success is **The Microwave Steam Method**: we steam the broccoli in the microwave for 2 minutes _before_ it hits the pan; this ensures it reaches a "tender-snap" consistency without needing a separate blanching pot. We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Batch Sear**: we cook the shrimp in small batches on high heat to ensure a caramelized Crunch rather than steaming them in their own juices.

## Directions

1.  **Steam:** Place broccoli in a small bowl with 2 tsp water. Cover and microwave for 2 minutes. Drain.
2.  **The Sauce:** In a small jar, whisk honey, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger until smooth.
3.  **Velvet:** Toss the shrimp with half of the sauce. Let sit for 5 minutes.
4.  **The Sear:** Heat oil in a heavy skillet or wok on **high**. Add shrimp in two batches. Sear for 1 minute per side until pink and charred. remove.
5.  **Bind:** Add the steamed broccoli and the remaining sauce to the pan. Toss for 1 minute over high heat until the honey bubbles and thickens into a glossy glaze.
6.  **Serve:** Return shrimp to the pan. Toss for 30 seconds. Serve immediately over steamed rice.
