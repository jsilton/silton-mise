## Chef's Note

This 15-minute meal uses smart shortcuts. Microwave the broccoli for 2 minutes with a bit of water before stir-frying—this pre-cooks it to tender-crisp without needing a separate pot. Sear the shrimp in small batches over high heat so they caramelize instead of steaming. The honey-soy-garlic sauce bubbles into a glossy glaze that coats everything. Simple and fast.

## Directions

1.  **Steam:** Place broccoli in a small bowl with 2 tsp water. Cover and microwave for 2 minutes. Drain.
2.  **The Sauce:** In a small jar, whisk honey, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger until smooth.
3.  **Velvet:** Toss the shrimp with half of the sauce. Let sit for 5 minutes.
4.  **The Sear:** Heat oil in a heavy skillet or wok on **high**. Add shrimp in two batches. Sear for 1 minute per side until pink and charred. remove.
5.  **Bind:** Add the steamed broccoli and the remaining sauce to the pan. Toss for 1 minute over high heat until the honey bubbles and thickens into a glossy glaze.
6.  **Serve:** Return shrimp to the pan. Toss for 30 seconds. Serve immediately over steamed rice.
