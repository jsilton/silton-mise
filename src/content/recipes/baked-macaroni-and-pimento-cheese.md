## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Prepare pasta according to package directions. Drain, and transfer to a large bowl.
3. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Gradually whisk in flour until smooth, cook, whisking constantly, 1 minute.
4. Gradually whisk in 2 cups milk and next 3 ingredients; cook, whisking constantly, 3 to 5 minutes or until thickened.
5. Stir in Cheddar cheese and pimiento until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat, and stir in the pasta.
6. Pour macaroni mixture into a lightly greased 13- x 9-inch baking dish; do not chill.
7. If you want the breadcrumb topping, stir together the breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese in a small bowl, and sprinkle over the pasta.
8. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden and bubbly.
9. Southwestern Variation: Substitute green chiles for the pimento, and use pepper jack cheese.
