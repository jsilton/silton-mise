## Chef's Note

This is a **Updated Classic** update to a Southern staple. By combining the sharp tang of pimentos with a classic Mornay sauce (the roux + cheese), we get a dish that is far more sophisticated than standard mac and cheese. The secret to the Kitchen Standard here is using **Freshly Shredded Cheddar**—pre-shredded cheese is coated in cellulose which prevents a perfectly smooth melt. The panko-parmesan topping provides the necessary Crunch to contrast the creamy pasta.

## Directions

1.  **Pasta:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Cook macaroni according to package directions until **al dente**. Drain and set aside.
2.  **The Roux:** In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute until fragrant but not browned.
3.  **The Sauce:** Gradually whisk in milk, salt, cayenne, and garlic powder. Cook, whisking constantly, for 3-5 minutes until the sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon.
4.  **Fold:** Stir in the shredded Cheddar and drained pimentos until completely melted and glossy. Remove from heat and fold in the cooked pasta.
5.  **Bake:** Pour the mixture into a greased 9x13 baking dish.
6.  **Topping:** Mix panko and Parmesan in a small bowl. Sprinkle evenly over the top.
7.  **Finish:** Bake for 15-20 minutes until the edges are bubbling and the topping is golden brown.
