## Chef's Note

Real Shawarma is roasted on a vertical spit (Doner) for hours. At home, we achieve the same **Texture Contrast** (tender meat + crispy charred bits) by using a high-temperature oven roast followed by a quick pan-sear. The cinnamon and turmeric provide that unmistakable warm, Middle Eastern aroma.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** Whisk the oil, lemon juice, and all spices. Toss with the chicken thighs. Marinate for at least 4 hours (ideally overnight).
2.  **Roast:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Place the chicken thighs on a foil-lined sheet. Roast for 15-18 minutes until cooked through.
3.  **The Char:** Remove from oven and slice into thin strips. Heat a heavy skillet over high heat with 1 tsp oil.
4.  **Sear:** Add the chicken strips to the skillet. Cook undisturbed for 2 minutes until the edges are crispy and blackened.
5.  **Serve:** Pile the meat onto a platter. Top with [Tahini Sauce](/silton-mise/recipes/tahini-sauce).
