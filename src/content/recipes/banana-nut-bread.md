## Chef's Note

The secret to banana bread that isn't dense or dry is precision with measurements. Bananas vary wildly in size, so weighing them ensures consistent results. We use melted butter for a tender, cake-like crumb and ensure the bananas are dead-ripe (black spots) to maximize the natural sugars. This is an improved version of a family classic.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 9x5 loaf pan.
2.  **Melt:** Melt the butter and let it cool slightly.
3.  **Wet:** In a large bowl, whisk the mashed bananas, melted butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla until smooth.
4.  **Dry:** In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, and salt.
5.  **Combine:** Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet until **just combined**. Do not over-mix. Fold in the nuts/seeds.
6.  **Bake:** Pour into the pan. Bake for 55-60 minutes until the top is split and a tester comes out clean.
7.  **Rest:** Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.
