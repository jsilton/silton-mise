## Chef's Note
This salad is a masterclass in **Texture Integrity** through **The Roasted Stacks Pattern**. We roast golden beets at high heat (425°F) until they reach an earthy, "Snap" tender consistency, then layer them with raw tomatoes and fresh peaches. This creates a spectrum of grain structures in every forkful. The mandatory **Acid Finish** comes from the lemon-honey-shallot emulsion, which provides the "High Note" needed to bridge the sweet stone fruit and the creamy goat cheese.

## Directions

1.  **Roast Beets:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Place scrubbed beets in a baking dish with 1 inch of water. Cover tightly with foil. Bake for 1 hour until tender. Cool, peel, and slice into 1/4-inch rounds.
2.  **Prep:** Slice tomatoes into 1/4-inch rounds. Arrange the beet and tomato slices in an overlapping pattern on a large platter. Season with salt and pepper.
3.  **The Emulsion:** In a small bowl, whisk olive oil, 1 tbsp lemon juice, honey, and shallots until thick.
4.  **Macerate:** Toss the sliced peaches with the remaining 1 tbsp lemon juice.
5.  **Assemble:** Mound the peach slices in the center of the platter. 
6.  **Finish:** Drizzle the honey-shallot glaze over everything. Garnish with crumbled goat cheese, fresh mint, and thyme for the mandatory aromatic **High Note**.
