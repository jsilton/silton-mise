## Chef's Note

The secret to sweet potato fries that aren't limp and oily is proper spacing. Sweet potatoes have more moisture than Russets; you must spread them across two separate baking sheets to ensure every fry has at least 1 inch of space. This allows the hot air to circulate, resulting in caramelized edges rather than steamed softness. We use smoked paprika as the essential savory element—it introduces a wood-fired depth that balances the natural sweetness of the potato.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.
2.  **Cut:** Slice sweet potatoes into uniform sticks, about 1/2-inch wide and 3 inches long.
3.  **Toss:** In a large bowl, whisk the oil and all spices. Add the potatoes and toss vigorously until every stick is perfectly coated.
4.  **The Guard:** Spread the fries onto the two pans. Ensure **no fries are touching**.
5.  **Bake:** Roast for 15 minutes. Flip the fries with a metal spatula.
6.  **The Crunch:** Roast for another 10-12 minutes until the edges are dark brown and crispy.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately while hot. (Note: do not cover them, or the steam will destroy the snap).
