## Chef's Note
This is the baseline for 30-minute "Speed" fuel. The secret to Success is **The High-Heat Char Pattern**: we roast the entire pan at 375°F but finish with a **3-minute broil**. This ensures the chicken stays moist (The "Bounce") while the peppers develop those charred, blackened edges (The "Snap") usually only found on a cast-iron sizzle platter. The fresh lime juice added *after* baking is the mandatory **Acid Finish** that keeps the seasoning from feeling flat.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** In a large bowl, toss the chicken, peppers, and onions with the oil, taco seasoning, and half the lime juice. **Let stand for 10 minutes** while the oven heats.
2.  **Spread:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Spread the mixture onto a large rimmed sheet pan in a single, even layer. 
3.  **Bake:** Roast for 15-20 minutes until the chicken is cooked through (165°F). 
4.  **The Snap:** Turn the oven to "Broil" (High). Move the pan to the top rack. Broil for 2-3 minutes until the vegetables are charred and the chicken skin is crispy.
5.  **Finish:** Squeeze the remaining lime juice over the hot pan. 
6.  **Serve:** Serve with warm tortillas, avocado, and cilantro for the final aromatic **High Note**.
