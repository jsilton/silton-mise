## Chef's Note

These Tex-Mex sheet pan fajitas simplify the traditional skillet method by roasting chicken and peppers at 375°F, then finishing with a quick broil to char the vegetables. This creates the characteristic blackened edges typically achieved on a sizzling cast-iron platter while keeping the chicken moist. Fresh lime juice added after cooking brightens the seasoning.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** In a large bowl, toss the chicken, peppers, and onions with the oil, taco seasoning, and half the lime juice. **Let stand for 10 minutes** while the oven heats.
2.  **Spread:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Spread the mixture onto a large rimmed sheet pan in a single, even layer.
3.  **Bake:** Roast for 15-20 minutes until the chicken is cooked through (165°F).
4.  **The Crunch:** Turn the oven to "Broil" (High). Move the pan to the top rack. Broil for 2-3 minutes until the vegetables are charred and the chicken skin is crispy.
5.  **Finish:** Squeeze the remaining lime juice over the hot pan.
6.  **Serve:** Serve with warm tortillas, avocado, and cilantro for fresh finishing touches.
