2. Toss the chicken, red onion and bell peppers together with the marinade. If you have time, allow to marinate, covered for 1 hour. If not, bake right away.
3. Preheat oven to 375° F.
4. Spread the chicken and vegetable mixture onto a rimmed sheet pan. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until meat is cooked through. If you want to add some char to meat and veggies, broil for another 3 minutes.
