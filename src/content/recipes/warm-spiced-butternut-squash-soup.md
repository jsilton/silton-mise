## Chef's Note

This is a wonderful holiday soup with deep flavor. The secret is making a scrap stock: we simmer the squash peels, seeds, and trimmings with whole cinnamon and star anise for 45 minutes to create a concentrated, spiced broth. This introduces a complex flavor that plain water lacks. We use a two-stage cooking method: roasting the squash cubes in the pot with onions _before_ adding the broth creates caramelized flavors that define the puree.

## Directions

1.  **Harvest Broth:** Peel and seed the squash. Place all trimmings, seeds, and whole spices in a pot with 7 cups water. Simmer for 45 minutes. Strain and reserve the liquid.
2.  **Sauté:** Cube the squash flesh. In a large Dutch oven, sauté onion in 1 tbsp oil until soft. Add squash cubes; cook for 10 minutes until edges are browned.
3.  **Simmer:** Pour the spiced harvest broth over the squash. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 40 minutes until the squash is very tender.
4.  **The Emulsion:** Transfer to a blender. Remove the center cap to allow steam to escape. Puree until perfectly smooth.
5.  **Finish:** Stir in the cider vinegar and red pepper flakes for the mandatory **Acid Balance**.
6.  **Serve:** Ladle into bowls. Top with pomegranate arils and fresh cilantro for the final **High Note**.
