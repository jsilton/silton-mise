## Chef's Note

This is the definitive Silton "Project" dessert. The secret to its incredible texture is **Structural Science** through **The EVOO Emulsion Pattern**. Unlike butter cakes, olive oil provides a consistent, liquid fat that ensures a moist "Bounce" that lasts for days. We use a **Double-Leavening Pattern** (soda and powder) to ensure a tall, airy rise that contrasts the heavy oil. The mandatory **Acid Finish** comes from using the full juice and zest of two lemons—this bright "High Note" is essential to cut through the grassy notes of the extra-virgin oil.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment.
2.  **The Base:** In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, olive oil, and sugar until completely smooth and pale yellow.
3.  **Emulsify:** Whisk in the milk, vanilla, lemon juice, and zest until the mixture looks like a thick, glossy cream.
4.  **Dry Mix:** In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.
5.  **Combine:** Gradually pour the egg mixture into the dry ingredients. Whisk in a circular motion until **just smooth**. Small lumps are mandatory for a light crumb.
6.  **Bake:** Pour into the prepared pan. Sprinkle 1 tbsp sugar over the surface for a crystalline "Snap." Bake for 50 minutes until golden brown.
7.  **Set:** Let cool completely in the pan before unmolding.
8.  **Finish:** Dust with powdered sugar and extra lemon zest just before serving.
