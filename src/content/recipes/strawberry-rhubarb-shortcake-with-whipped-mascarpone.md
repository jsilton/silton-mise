## Chef's Note

This is the definitive Silton "Project" dessert. The secret to its Success is **Structural Science** through **The Cold Fat Pattern**: we cut cold butter into the flour until pea-sized, ensuring a flaky, vertical rise. We use **Pink Peppercorns** as the mandatory savory-sweet **High Note**—their floral heat bridges the gap between the tart rhubarb and the creamy mascarpone. We maintain **Texture Integrity** by **Roasting the Fruit**: baking the strawberries and rhubarb at 350°F concentrates their juices into a thick, mahogany syrup that won't turn the shortcake soggy.

## Directions

1.  **The Dough:** Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and peppercorns. Cut in cold butter. Stir in buttermilk until a shaggy dough forms.
2.  **Shape:** Knead 3 times. Pat into a 1-inch thick rectangle. Cut into six 3-inch squares. **Refrigerate for 30 minutes** (The Gluten Rest).
3.  **The Roast:** Toss strawberries, rhubarb, St. Germain, vanilla seeds, and sugar. Spread on a baking sheet. Roast at 350°F for 20 minutes until syrupy.
4.  **Bake Shortcake:** Brush biscuit tops with cream. Sprinkle with coarse sugar. Bake at 350°F for 25 minutes until deep golden.
5.  **The Emulsion:** Whip mascarpone and 1/4 cup sugar until smooth. Slowly pour in heavy cream and whip to stiff peaks. Stir in a splash of St. Germain.
6.  **Assemble:** Split warm shortcakes. Top with a massive mound of roasted fruit and its syrup.
7.  **Finish:** Add a dollop of mascarpone cream and fresh thyme for the final **High Note**.
