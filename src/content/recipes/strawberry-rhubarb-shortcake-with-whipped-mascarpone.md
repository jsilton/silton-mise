## Directions

1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. Measure out flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and ground pink peppercorns into a bowl with high sides. Whisk to combine.
3. Cut the cold butter into 1/2" cubes. Use a pastry blender, two butter knives or your hands to blend the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles a coarse meal with small, visible butter chunks.
4. Make a well in the center of the mixture and pour in the buttermilk or heavy cream. Mix with a fork until the dough just begins to come together in large clumps, it wont take long.
5. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently a few times until it becomes a somewhat cohesive mass. Pat the dough into a rectangle, 6" x 9" and 1" thick. Use a sharp knife to cut the dough into 6, 3" squares. Transfer to lined baking sheet and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
6. Preheat the oven to 350°.
7. For a crisp top, brush the tops of the shortcakes lightly with melted butter or cream. Sprinkle with sparkling or sanding sugar.
8. Bake for 25-30 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. They should be a warm golden brown on top and a toasty brown on the bottom. Set aside to cool.
9. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
10. Cut rhubarb into 1" bite sized pieces and chop strawberries into half or quarters, if they are large. Slice half of one lemon into wheels. Add all 3 to a mixing bowl. Slice half of a vanilla bean down the center and scrape the seeds into the bowl, toss in the scraped beans. Add sugar, the juice from the remaining lemon half, a few sprigs of thyme and St. Germain. Toss to combine and set aside for 10-15 minutes.
11. Preheat oven to 350°.
12. Transfer the fruit to a lined baking sheet and roast until the fruit is tender and juices are thick and syrupy, about 20 minutes, depending on thickness of the rhubarb stalks. Allow the filling to cool and discard the vanilla bean, thyme and lemon wheels.
13. Chill the mixing bowl and whip attachment in the freezer for a few minutes prior to mixing.
14. Place the mascarpone cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whip attachment, and whip on medium high for 1 minute. Slowly add heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract in the bowl and whip on medium high the until it turns into light and fluffy, it should only take a minute or two.
15. Slowly whip in the St. Germain until mixed in.
16. Cover and place in the fridge until ready to serve. *It helps to keep everything at room temperature to prevent curdling.
17. Gently split the shortcakes in half. Top with a generous spoonful of the fruit and a big ol' dollop of whip cream. Add a few thyme leaves on top of the whipped mascarpone cream for an herby freshness and top with the shortcake lid. Serve with sparkling Rosé with a splash of St. Germain.
