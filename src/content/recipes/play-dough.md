## Chef's Note

This is the baseline **Modularity** component for family productivity. The secret to a play-dough that has a resilient, professional Texture is **Culinary Technique** through **The Heat-Gelatinization Method**. Unlike no-cook versions, cooking the dough on the stovetop ensures the starch molecules are fully cross-linked, resulting in a Crunch that doesn't stick to hands. The **Cream of Tartar** is mandatory—it acts as a gluten-stiffener and a natural preservative.

## Directions

1.  **Combine:** In a medium non-stick saucepan, whisk together the flour, salt, and cream of tartar.
2.  **Emulsify:** Add the water, oil, and food coloring. Whisk until no lumps remain.
3.  **The Cook:** Place over medium heat. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon for 3-5 minutes.
4.  **The Pull:** The mixture will look like a liquid, then suddenly clump together. Continue stirring until the dough pulls away from the sides of the pan and forms a single, non-sticky ball.
5.  **Knead:** Remove from heat and place on a clean surface. Once cool enough to touch, knead for 1 minute until perfectly smooth.
6.  **Store:** Store in an airtight container for up to 6 months to maintain the "Bounce."
