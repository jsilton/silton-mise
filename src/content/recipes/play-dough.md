## Chef's Note

This is an easy homemade play-dough recipe. The secret to a resilient, professional texture is cooking it on the stovetop. Unlike no-cook versions, heating the dough ensures the starch molecules are fully gelatinized, resulting in a smooth consistency that doesn't stick to hands. The cream of tartar is essential—it acts as a stabilizer and a natural preservative.

## Directions

1.  **Combine:** In a medium non-stick saucepan, whisk together the flour, salt, and cream of tartar.
2.  **Emulsify:** Add the water, oil, and food coloring. Whisk until no lumps remain.
3.  **The Cook:** Place over medium heat. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon for 3-5 minutes.
4.  **The Pull:** The mixture will look like a liquid, then suddenly clump together. Continue stirring until the dough pulls away from the sides of the pan and forms a single, non-sticky ball.
5.  **Knead:** Remove from heat and place on a clean surface. Once cool enough to touch, knead for 1 minute until perfectly smooth.
6.  **Store:** Store in an airtight container for up to 6 months to maintain the "Bounce."
