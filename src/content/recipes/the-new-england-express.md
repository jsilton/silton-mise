## Chef's Note

This cocktail is a masterclass in **Updated Classic** flavor layering. The secret to its Success is **The Herbal Syrup Method**: we boil the sugar into a simple syrup but steep the fresh thyme for 10 minutes _after_ removing from heat. This introduces a savory, botanical complex flavor that bridges the gap between the earthy apple cider and the rich molasses of the dark rum. The fresh lime juice provides the mandatory **Acid Balance** that defines the "Express" punch.

## Directions

1.  **The Syrup:** In a small pan, boil sugar and 1/3 cup water until dissolved. Remove from heat. Add thyme sprigs. Cover and **let stand for 10 minutes**. Strain and chill.
2.  **The Base:** In a large pitcher, combine the chilled thyme syrup, apple cider, dark rum, lime juice, and bitters. Stir vigorously.
3.  **Thermal Prep:** Fill 8 rocks glasses with massive ice cubes.
4.  **Assemble:** Pour the cider mixture into each glass, filling 3/4 full.
5.  **Effervescence:** Top each glass with a splash of club soda for the mandatory "Bounce."
6.  **Garnish:** Garnish with a fresh thyme sprig and a lime slice for the final aromatic **High Note**.
