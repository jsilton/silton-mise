## Chef's Note
The secret to a professional-grade cookie cake is **Texture Integrity** through the **Disc Pattern**. Using chocolate discs rather than standard chips creates larger "pools" of molten chocolate that integrate into the dough. We use **M&Ms** to provide a necessary "Salty Snap" and color. The Silton Standard for this dish is **High-Heat Edge Crisp**: we bake at 375°F to ensure the outer rim is shatteringly crisp while the center remains "Soft and Chewy."

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a 14-inch round pizza pan (or a large sheet pan) with parchment paper and grease lightly.
2.  **Cream:** In a large bowl, cream the butter and both sugars until light and fluffy (3-5 mins). Add eggs and vanilla; beat until combined.
3.  **Dry Mix:** Stir in the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until **just combined**—do not overwork the gluten.
4.  **Fold:** Fold in the chocolate discs and 1/2 cup of the M&Ms.
5.  **Shape:** Spread the dough evenly onto the prepared pan, leaving a 1/2-inch border for expansion. Sprinkle the remaining 3/4 cup M&Ms over the top, pressing them in lightly.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 20-25 minutes until the edges are deep golden brown and the center is set but still soft.
7.  **Cool:** Let cool completely in the pan before slicing. This allows the internal structure to firm up.
