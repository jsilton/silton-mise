## Chef's Note

This is a baseline **Modern Heritage** recipe for high-performance lunch fuel. The secret to its Success is **The Pull-Not-Cut Pattern**: you must poach the chicken tenders and then manually pull them into shreds while warm; this ensures the maximum surface area for the mayonnaise to bind to, resulting in a rich "Bounce." We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The Cold Snap**: using quartered grapes and finely diced celery provides a necessary watery crunch that cuts through the rich mayo. Always add a hit of fresh lemon to provide the mandatory **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **Poach:** Bring a pot of salted water to a gentle boil. Add chicken tenders and cook for 8-10 minutes until just cooked through. Drain and let cool for 5 minutes.
2.  **The Pull:** While still warm, use two forks (or your hands) to pull the chicken into bite-sized shreds. Place in a large bowl.
3.  **The Mix:** In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, lemon juice, salt, and pepper until perfectly smooth.
4.  **Combine:** Add the celery, grapes, and minced red onion to the chicken. Pour the dressing over the top.
5.  **Fold:** Toss gently until every piece of chicken is coated in the creamy emulsion.
6.  **Set:** Refrigerate for **at least 30 minutes** before serving. This allows the flavors to bloom and the texture to firm up.
