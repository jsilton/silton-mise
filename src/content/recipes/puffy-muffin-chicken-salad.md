## Chef's Note

This is a classic recipe for satisfying lunch fuel. The technique is poaching the chicken tenders and then manually pulling them into shreds while warm. This ensures maximum surface area for the mayonnaise to bind to, resulting in a rich, cohesive salad. Using quartered grapes and finely diced celery provides necessary crisp texture that cuts through the rich mayo. Always add a hit of fresh lemon for brightness.

## Directions

1.  **Poach:** Bring a pot of salted water to a gentle boil. Add chicken tenders and cook for 8-10 minutes until just cooked through. Drain and let cool for 5 minutes.
2.  **The Pull:** While still warm, use two forks (or your hands) to pull the chicken into bite-sized shreds. Place in a large bowl.
3.  **The Mix:** In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, lemon juice, salt, and pepper until perfectly smooth.
4.  **Combine:** Add the celery, grapes, and minced red onion to the chicken. Pour the dressing over the top.
5.  **Fold:** Toss gently until every piece of chicken is coated in the creamy emulsion.
6.  **Set:** Refrigerate for **at least 30 minutes** before serving. This allows the flavors to bloom and the texture to firm up.
