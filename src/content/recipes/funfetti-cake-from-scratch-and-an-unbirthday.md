## Chef's Note

Whipping egg whites separately and folding them in at the end creates light, airy texture. Use long cylindrical jimmies rather than round nonpareils - nonpareils bleed their color and turn batter gray, while jimmies provide colorful pops throughout. Apply a thin crumb coat first, freeze briefly, then add final frosting layer for cleanest finish.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease and flour three 8-inch round pans.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a stand mixer, beat 9 tbsp butter, sugar, and oil on medium-low until creamy. Stir in vanilla.
3.  **Dry Mix:** Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.
4.  **Combine:** Alternately add the dry mix and the milk to the butter mixture, beginning and ending with the dry. Stir until **just combined**.
5.  **Aeration:** In a clean bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form.
6.  **The Fold:** Gently fold the whipped whites and sprinkles into the batter using a spatula. Do not over-mix.
7.  **Bake:** Divide among pans. Bake for 35-40 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in pans for 15 minutes, then invert onto racks.
8.  **The Frosting:** Beat 1 lb butter until creamy. Gradually add sugar, then heavy cream and vanilla. Beat on high for 3 minutes until billowy.
9.  **Assemble:** Layer the cooled cakes with frosting. Do a thin "crumb coat" and freeze for 10 minutes before applying the final thick layer of buttercream for a professional Crunch finish.
