## Chef's Note

The secret to "Bakery Quality" muffins using frozen fruit is **Textural Balance** through **The Frozen Berry Fold**. You must never thaw the berries before adding them to the batter; adding them frozen ensures they maintain their Crunch and prevents the juice from bleeding, which would turn the entire muffin a muddy purple. We finish with a **Nutmeg Sugar Dusting**—this provides the mandatory "High Note" aroma that defines a professional-grade breakfast muffin.

## Directions

1.  **The Emulsion:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Grease two 12-cup muffin tins. In a large bowl, cream the butter and 2 cups minus 2 tbsp of the sugar until light and fluffy (3-5 mins). Add eggs one at a time, followed by milk and vanilla.
2.  **Dry Mix:** Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.
3.  **Combine:** Fold the dry ingredients into the wet until **just combined**. A few streaks of flour are fine.
4.  **The Fold:** Gently fold in the **frozen blueberries**. Do not over-mix.
5.  **The Topping:** In a small bowl, whisk the remaining 2 tbsp sugar with the nutmeg.
6.  **Bake:** Divide the batter among the cups (about 2/3 full). Sprinkle the nutmeg sugar over the tops. Bake for 20-25 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean.
7.  **Cool:** Let sit in the pan for 10 minutes to allow the fruit structure to set before removing to a wire rack.
