A refined Italian scaloppine dish. The secret is dusting the chicken in flour before searing (to create a crust and thicken the sauce) and finishing with cold butter to create a glossy, emulsified lemon-tomato glaze.

## Directions

1. Dredge: Mix flour, salt, and pepper on a plate. Press chicken thighs into the flour to coat, then shake off all excess. (This creates the crust).
2. Sear: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over Medium-High. Sear chicken for 4 minutes per side until golden. Remove to a plate.
3. Bloom: Reduce heat to Medium. Add garlic and Tomato Paste to the pan drippings. Fry for 2 minutes until the paste turns dark red (essential for depth).
4. Glaze: Pour in broth and lemon juice. Scrape up the browned bits. The leftover flour in the pan will instantly thicken this into a sauce.
5. Simmer: Return chicken to the pan. Simmer for 4–5 minutes until cooked through.
6. Finish: Turn heat to Low. Stir in the Cold Butter and the fresh spinach. Toss gently until the butter melts (creating a gloss) and spinach is wilted. Serve immediately.
