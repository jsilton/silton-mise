## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate high-speed nutritious main. The secret to its Success is **The Boursin Melt Method**: we place a block of Boursin cheese directly in the center of the baking dish surrounded by the raw orzo and broth. As it bakes, the cheese emulsifies with the chicken juices to create a thick, garlic-herb Texture that standard cream cannot mimic. We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Lemon Sizzle**: placing fresh lemon slices over the chicken provides a mandatory **Acid Balance** that keeps the rich cheese from feeling heavy.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** Toss diced chicken with olive oil, garlic salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Squeeze the juice of 1 lemon over the top.
2.  **Assemble:** In a 9x13-inch baking dish, scatter the dry orzo. Pour in the chicken broth.
3.  **Layer:** Place the block of Boursin in the very center. Arrange the chicken and sun-dried tomatoes around the cheese.
4.  **Wilt:** Add the dry spinach in small clumps. Top the entire dish with the remaining lemon slices.
5.  **Bake:** Bake at 400°F for 35 minutes until the orzo is tender and the chicken is cooked through.
6.  **Bind:** Remove from oven. Remove the lemon slices. **Stir vigorously** for 1 minute until the Boursin has emulsified into a creamy, glossy sauce.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with extra black pepper and serve hot.
