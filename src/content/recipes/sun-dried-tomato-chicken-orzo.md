## Chef's Note

One-pan baked pastas became wildly popular in the 2010s, and this version uses Boursin cheese as a shortcut to creamy, garlicky flavor. Place the block of Boursin right in the center of the baking dish with the raw orzo and broth—as it bakes, the cheese melts and emulsifies with the chicken juices. Fresh lemon slices over the chicken add brightness to balance the rich cheese. Stir vigorously when it comes out of the oven to create a creamy sauce.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** Toss diced chicken with olive oil, garlic salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Squeeze the juice of 1 lemon over the top.
2.  **Assemble:** In a 9x13-inch baking dish, scatter the dry orzo. Pour in the chicken broth.
3.  **Layer:** Place the block of Boursin in the very center. Arrange the chicken and sun-dried tomatoes around the cheese.
4.  **Wilt:** Add the dry spinach in small clumps. Top the entire dish with the remaining lemon slices.
5.  **Bake:** Bake at 400°F for 35 minutes until the orzo is tender and the chicken is cooked through.
6.  **Bind:** Remove from oven. Remove the lemon slices. **Stir vigorously** for 1 minute until the Boursin has emulsified into a creamy, glossy sauce.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with extra black pepper and serve hot.
