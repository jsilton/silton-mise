The official cocktail of New Orleans, the Sazerac dates back to the 1830s and is one of America's oldest cocktails. This complex, spirit-forward drink features rye whiskey, absinthe, and Peychaud's bitters for a uniquely aromatic experience.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz rye whiskey (or Cognac for the original recipe)
- 1/4 oz simple syrup
- 3 dashes Peychaud's bitters
- 1-2 dashes Angostura bitters (optional, but traditional)
- Absinthe or Herbsaint for rinsing
- Lemon peel for garnish
- Ice

## Directions

1. Chill an Old Fashioned glass by filling it with ice water or placing it in the freezer.

2. In a mixing glass, combine the rye whiskey, simple syrup, and bitters with ice. Stir well for 20-30 seconds.

3. Discard the ice water from the chilled glass. Add a small amount of absinthe (about 1/4 oz) to the glass and swirl to coat the inside, then discard the excess absinthe.

4. Strain the stirred whiskey mixture into the absinthe-rinsed glass (no ice).

5. Express a lemon peel over the drink by twisting it to release the oils. Discard the peel or rest it on the rim (traditionally, it's discarded).

6. Serve immediately.

## Chef's Note

The Sazerac is one of America's oldest cocktails, created in New Orleans in the 1830s, and it's been the city's official cocktail since 2008. Originally made with Cognac, it switched to rye whiskey when the phylloxera epidemic devastated French vineyards in the 1870s. The drink is named after the Sazerac Coffee House where it was popularized, which itself was named after a brand of Cognac. The absinthe rinse is essential - it provides an aromatic backdrop without overwhelming the whiskey and bitters.
