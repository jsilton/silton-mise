## Chef's Note

The common mistake with baked oatmeal is a mushy, uniform texture. We apply the **Silton Texture Pattern**: we layer the berries at the bottom and use **Toasted Seeds** on top to provide a satisfying "pop" and "crunch" that contrasts with the creamy oats. Always pat down the dry oats into the milk to ensure even hydration.

## Directions

1.  **Dry:** In a bowl, toss oats, seeds, cinnamon, salt, and baking powder.
2.  **Wet:** Whisk milk, eggs, maple syrup, vanilla, and half the melted butter.
3.  **Layer:** Arrange 1 cup of blueberries at the bottom of a greased baking dish. Cover with the oat mixture.
4.  **Hydrate:** Pour the milk mixture over the oats. Wiggle the dish so the liquid sinks in. Top with remaining berries.
5.  **Bake:** Bake at 375°F for 40-45 minutes until the top is golden and the center is set.
6.  **Finish:** Drizzle with the remaining melted butter.
