## Chef's Note

Layering berries at the bottom prevents a mushy, uniform texture - they stay whole and jammy. Toasted sunflower or pumpkin seeds on top add crunch that contrasts with creamy oats below. Press the dry oats down into the milk mixture before baking to ensure even hydration.

## Directions

1.  **Dry:** In a bowl, toss oats, seeds, cinnamon, salt, and baking powder.
2.  **Wet:** Whisk milk, eggs, maple syrup, vanilla, and half the melted butter.
3.  **Layer:** Arrange 1 cup of blueberries at the bottom of a greased baking dish. Cover with the oat mixture.
4.  **Hydrate:** Pour the milk mixture over the oats. Wiggle the dish so the liquid sinks in. Top with remaining berries.
5.  **Bake:** Bake at 375°F for 40-45 minutes until the top is golden and the center is set.
6.  **Finish:** Drizzle with the remaining melted butter.
