## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
2. In a large bowl, mix the ricotta, mozzarella, ¾ cup of the Parmesan, spinach, egg, and salt.
3. In a 13 x 9 inch baking dish, spread ¾ cup sauce on the bottom. Layer a few of the noodles on top. Spread a third of the cheese mixture on top of that and then another 3/4 cup sauce. Repeat layers until all ingredients are gone, ending with the sauce.
4. Top with remaining ¼ cup Parmesan, cover with foil, and bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 20 to 25 minutes or until the noodles have completely softened. Let rest for 5 minutes, serve warm, and enjoy!
