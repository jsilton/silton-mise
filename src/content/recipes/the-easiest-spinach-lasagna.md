## Chef's Note

Lasagna originated in Naples and is one of Italy's oldest pasta dishes, with recipes dating back to the 14th century. The no-boil lasagna sheets are a modern American invention from the 1990s that saves time but requires a saucier sauce to hydrate properly during baking. Squeeze that spinach bone-dry - frozen spinach holds an astonishing amount of water that will make your lasagna watery. This is perfect make-ahead food: assemble up to 24 hours in advance, refrigerate covered, and add 10 minutes to baking time.

## Directions

1.  **The Filling:** In a large bowl, whisk the egg. Mix in the ricotta, mozzarella, 3/4 cup of the Parmesan, the squeezed spinach, salt, and pepper until well combined.
2.  **Layer 1:** Spread 3/4 cup of sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. This prevents the bottom noodles from sticking.
3.  **Layer 2:** Place a layer of no-boil noodles on top (they shouldn't overlap much). Spread 1/3 of the cheese mixture over the noodles, then top with another 3/4 cup of sauce.
4.  **Repeat:** Repeat the layers (Noodles -> Cheese -> Sauce) until all ingredients are used, ending with a final layer of sauce.
5.  **Finish:** Top with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan. Cover tightly with foil.
6.  **Bake:** Bake at 375°F for 30 minutes.
7.  **Crisp:** Remove the foil and bake for another 20-25 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and the noodles are tender.
8.  **Rest:** Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing. This is critical for the layers to set.
