## Chef's Note

The secret to successful "No-Boil" lasagna is the **Sauce-to-Pasta Ratio**. No-boil sheets need moisture to hydrate in the oven; if your sauce is too thick, the noodles will stay crunchy. We use an **Egg Binder** in the ricotta to ensure the layers set into a sliceable, restaurant-quality structure rather than a watery pool. Always serve with a bright green salad to cut the heavy cheese.

## Directions

1.  **The Filling:** In a large bowl, whisk the egg. Mix in the ricotta, mozzarella, 3/4 cup of the Parmesan, the squeezed spinach, salt, and pepper until well combined.
2.  **Layer 1:** Spread 3/4 cup of sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. This prevents the bottom noodles from sticking.
3.  **Layer 2:** Place a layer of no-boil noodles on top (they shouldn't overlap much). Spread 1/3 of the cheese mixture over the noodles, then top with another 3/4 cup of sauce.
4.  **Repeat:** Repeat the layers (Noodles -> Cheese -> Sauce) until all ingredients are used, ending with a final layer of sauce.
5.  **Finish:** Top with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan. Cover tightly with foil.
6.  **Bake:** Bake at 375°F for 30 minutes.
7.  **Crisp:** Remove the foil and bake for another 20-25 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and the noodles are tender.
8.  **Rest:** Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing. This is critical for the layers to set.
