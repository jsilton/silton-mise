## Chef's Note

This is a quick microwave mug cake. The secret to a mug cake that isn't a rubbery brick is dropping a spoonful of hazelnut spread into the center without stirring. This creates a molten core that keeps the cake moist from the inside out. The high-heat microwave gelatinizes the starch in 70 seconds, providing an immediate rise. The tiny pinch of salt bridges the dark cocoa and rich hazelnut.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** In a large (14 oz) microwave-safe mug, whisk flour, cocoa, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
2.  **Emulsify:** Add the milk and oil. Whisk with a fork until no flour pockets remain and the batter is glossy.
3.  **The Core:** Drop the hazelnut spread into the center of the batter. **Do not push it down.**
4.  **Cook:** Microwave on **High for 70 seconds**. (The cake will riseVertical and then sink slightly—this is the Texture setting).
5.  **The Finish:** Let stand for 1 minute before eating. This allows the crumb to set and the center to become molten.
6.  **Serve:** Dust with a tiny bit of powdered sugar if feeling fancy.
