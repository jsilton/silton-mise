  - 1/4 cup all-purpose flour

  - >-
    2 tablespoon granulated sugar (you can add 1 tbsp. more if you like it a bit

## Directions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together dry ingredients.
2. Whisk in the milk and vegetable oil until all ingredients are combined and batter has no clumps.
3. Pour batter into a microwave-safe mug. Mine was a 14-ounce mug. You want enough head space for the cake to rise without pouring over.
4. Add 1 tbsp. of hazelnut chocolate spread in the middle of the batter. Just drop it in the middle, no need to push it down and sink it in the batter.
5. Place a paper towel into the microwave and set the mug on top (this is to catch any batter if your mug cake overflows).
6. Microwave mug cake for 70 seconds on high (PLEASE READ NOTES CAREFULLY BELOW)
7. Carefully remove from microwave and enjoy!
