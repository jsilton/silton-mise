## Chef's Note

Blanching green beans for exactly 3 minutes, then shocking them in ice water locks in their chlorophyll and prevents them from overcooking into mushy brown pods. The honey-lemon glaze balances sweetness against sharp citrus acidity, glazing the shallots with sticky-sweet caramelization rather than leaving them merely sautéed.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare a large bowl with ice and cold water.
2.  **Blanch:** Cook green beans in the boiling water for 3-4 minutes until bright green.
3.  **Shock:** Immediately drain and submerge in the ice water. **Let sit for 2 minutes**, then drain and pat **bone-dry**.
4.  **Aromatics:** In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Sauté shallots for 2 minutes until translucent.
5.  **Glaze:** Add the honey and lemon juice. Stir for 1 minute until bubbling.
6.  **Toss:** Add the dry green beans and lemon zest to the pan. Toss vigorously for 2 minutes until the beans are warmed through and coated in a glossy, sweet-acidic film.
7.  **Serve:** Season with salt and black pepper. Serve immediately.
