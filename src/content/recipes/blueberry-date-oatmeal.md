## Chef's Note

Frozen riced cauliflower adds volume and fiber without affecting flavor. Stir frozen blueberries in at the end rather than cooking them - this prevents the oatmeal from turning gray while keeping berries whole and bright. Medjool dates provide natural caramel-like sweetness without refined sugar.

## Directions

1.  **Combine:** In a medium saucepan (stovetop) or a large microwave-safe bowl, combine oats, cauliflower, water/milk, chopped dates, and coconut oil.
2.  **Cook (Stovetop):** Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently, until the liquid is absorbed and the oats are creamy.
3.  **Cook (Microwave):** Heat on high for 3 minutes, stir, then heat for another 2-3 minutes until thickened.
4.  **The Berry Finish:** Remove from heat. Gently fold in the frozen blueberries. Let sit for 1 minute—the residual heat will thaw the berries while keeping them whole.
5.  **Serve:** Top with a pinch of sea salt and cinnamon.
