## Chef's Note

This is a high-performance nutritious breakfast. We use the **Volume Hack**: adding riced cauliflower increases the fiber and portion size without altering the flavor of the oats. To maintain **Textural Balance**, we stir the frozen blueberries in at the very end—this prevents the entire bowl from turning a muddy gray and preserves the "Pop" of the fruit. The dates provide a natural, caramel-like sweetness that eliminates the need for refined sugar.

## Directions

1.  **Combine:** In a medium saucepan (stovetop) or a large microwave-safe bowl, combine oats, cauliflower, water/milk, chopped dates, and coconut oil.
2.  **Cook (Stovetop):** Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently, until the liquid is absorbed and the oats are creamy.
3.  **Cook (Microwave):** Heat on high for 3 minutes, stir, then heat for another 2-3 minutes until thickened.
4.  **The Berry Finish:** Remove from heat. Gently fold in the frozen blueberries. Let sit for 1 minute—the residual heat will thaw the berries while keeping them whole.
5.  **Serve:** Top with a pinch of sea salt and cinnamon.
