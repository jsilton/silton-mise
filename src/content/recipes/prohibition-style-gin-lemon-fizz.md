## Chef's Note

This cocktail showcases complex aromatic layering. The combination of herbal gin, rich cognac, and a hint of smoky mezcal creates a flavor profile that balances depth with brightness. Spindrift Lemon instead of standard soda water provides real fruit acidity that bridges the agave and botanicals. The orange bitters are added twice (in the shaker and on the surface) to ensure the aroma precedes the flavor.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Chill 3 highball glasses in the freezer.
2.  **The Base:** In a cocktail shaker filled with large ice cubes, combine gin, mezcal, cognac, lemon juice, agave, and 4 dashes of the orange bitters.
3.  **Aeration:** Shake vigorously for 15 seconds until the shaker is frosted and the mixture is perfectly cold.
4.  **Strain:** Double strain the mixture into the chilled highball glasses filled with fresh ice.
5.  **Effervescence:** Top each glass with 4 oz of Spindrift Lemon. Stir once, very gently, to preserve the bubbles.
6.  **The Finishing Touch:** Add 1 final dash of orange bitters to the surface of each drink. Garnish with a lemon peel twist (expressed over the rim).
