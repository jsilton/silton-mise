## Chef's Note
This cocktail is a masterclass in **Structural Science** and aromatic layering. The secret to its Success is **The Smoky Emulsion Pattern**: the combination of herbal gin, rich cognac, and a pulse of mezcal creates a flavor profile that is both heavy and light. We use **Spindrift Lemon** instead of standard soda water to provide a real fruit **Acid Finish** that bridges the agave and gin. The orange bitters are added twice (in the shaker and on the surface) to ensure the aroma precedes the flavor.

## Directions

1.  **Thermal Prep:** Chill 3 highball glasses in the freezer.
2.  **The Base:** In a cocktail shaker filled with large ice cubes, combine gin, mezcal, cognac, lemon juice, agave, and 4 dashes of the orange bitters.
3.  **Aeration:** Shake vigorously for 15 seconds until the shaker is frosted and the mixture is perfectly cold.
4.  **Strain:** Double strain the mixture into the chilled highball glasses filled with fresh ice.
5.  **Effervescence:** Top each glass with 4 oz of Spindrift Lemon. Stir once, very gently, to preserve the bubbles.
6.  **The High Note:** Add 1 final dash of orange bitters to the surface of each drink. Garnish with a lemon peel twist (expressed over the rim).
