## Chef's Note
The secret to a restorative soup that doesn't feel "grainy" is **Structural Science** through **The Whole-Allium Pattern**. Instead of dicing the onion, we slow-cook the entire peeled onion whole and discard it at the end; this imparts a deep, sweet foundation without the texture of raw onion bits. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The Separate Boil Pattern**: while you can cook noodles in the pot, the Gold Standard is boiling them separately and adding them at the moment of serving—this ensures a resilient "Bounce" and prevents the broth from turning cloudy.

## Directions

1.  **Foundation:** Add chicken, whole onion, carrots, celery, garlic, rosemary bundle, and bay leaf to a 6-quart slow cooker. Pour in 6 cups of broth.
2.  **Slow Cook:** Cover and cook on **Low for 4-6 hours** (or High for 2-3) until chicken reaches 165°F.
3.  **The Pull:** Remove chicken. Discard the whole onion, bay leaf, and rosemary stalks. Shred chicken into large, succulent chunks.
4.  **The Noodle:** While chicken rests, boil the egg noodles in a separate pot until **al dente**. Drain.
5.  **Bind:** Return the shredded chicken and the cooked noodles to the slow cooker. 
6.  **Finish:** Add the remaining broth to reach your desired consistency. Stir in the parsley and a massive crack of black pepper.
7.  **Serve:** Ladle into bowls and serve immediately for maximum **High Note** freshness.
