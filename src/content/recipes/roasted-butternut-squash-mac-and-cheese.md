## Chef's Note

This is the "Gold Standard" for technical comfort food. The secret to its Success is **Texture Integrity** through **The Staged Roast Pattern**: we roast the butternut squash at high heat (400°F) until tender and charred _before_ folding it into the cheese sauce. This prevents the squash from dissolving into a mushy puree. We use **The Mornay Emulsion**: whisking Dijon and nutmeg into the roux creates a sophisticated "Bounce" that balances the heavy cheddar. The Panko topping provides the mandatory **Textural Snap**.

## Directions

1.  **Roast Squash:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss squash cubes with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast for 25-30 minutes until tender and caramelized. Lower oven to 350°F.
2.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water for 2 minutes **less** than package directions (very al dente).
3.  **The Roux:** In a large pot, melt 4 tbsp butter. Whisk in flour and cook for 2 minutes until golden.
4.  **Emulsify:** Slowly whisk in milk. Simmer until the sauce coats a spoon. Stir in the cheddar, mustard, nutmeg, and cayenne until molten.
5.  **Combine:** Fold the pasta and roasted squash into the cheese sauce. Transfer to a greased 2-quart dish.
6.  **The Snap:** Toss panko with 2 tbsp melted butter and Parmesan. Sprinkle over the top.
7.  **Bake:** Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes until bubbling and mahogany gold.
