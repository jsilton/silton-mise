## Chef's Note

Roasting butternut squash at 400°F until tender and charred before folding it into cheese sauce keeps the cubes intact rather than dissolving into mush during baking. Whisking Dijon and nutmeg into the roux creates a sophisticated mornay sauce that balances the sharp cheddar and adds complexity. Panko breadcrumbs tossed with butter and Parmesan provide essential crunch against the creamy pasta.

## Directions

1.  **Roast Squash:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss squash cubes with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast for 25-30 minutes until tender and caramelized. Lower oven to 350°F.
2.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water for 2 minutes **less** than package directions (very al dente).
3.  **The Roux:** In a large pot, melt 4 tbsp butter. Whisk in flour and cook for 2 minutes until golden.
4.  **Emulsify:** Slowly whisk in milk. Simmer until the sauce coats a spoon. Stir in the cheddar, mustard, nutmeg, and cayenne until molten.
5.  **Combine:** Fold the pasta and roasted squash into the cheese sauce. Transfer to a greased 2-quart dish.
6.  **The Crunch:** Toss panko with 2 tbsp melted butter and Parmesan. Sprinkle over the top.
7.  **Bake:** Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes until bubbling and mahogany gold.
