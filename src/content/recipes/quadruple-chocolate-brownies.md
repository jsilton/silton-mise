## Chef's Note

Folding chunks of bittersweet, white, and milk chocolate into unsweetened chocolate batter, then drizzling melted versions on top before swirling creates varying textures in every square—some pockets stay fudgy, others develop crisp edges. A full pound of unsweetened chocolate as the base provides bitter depth that balances the sugar and eggs, preventing these dense, rich brownies from tasting overly sweet.

## Directions

1.  **The Melt:** Preheat oven to 300°F. In a large saucepan, melt the butter and unsweetened chocolate over low heat until glossy. Let cool for 10 minutes.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a massive bowl, whisk sugar, eggs, vanilla, and salt until thick and pale. Stir in the melted chocolate.
3.  **Incorporate:** Gradually fold in the flour until **just combined**. Fold in 5 oz each of the chopped bittersweet, white, and milk chocolates.
4.  **Assemble:** Spread the batter into two greased 9x13-inch pans.
5.  **The Swirl:** Melt the remaining chopped chocolates in separate microwave-safe bowls. Drizzle the three chocolates over the batter and use a knife to create a marbled "High Note" pattern.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 35-40 minutes until the tops are mirror-shiny and the edges are firm.
7.  **The Finish:** Cool **completely** in the pans before slicing into squares. This is mandatory for the structural integrity.
