## Chef's Note
This is the definitive Silton "Crowd-Pleaser" and a masterclass in **Texture Integrity**. The secret to its success is **The Triple-Marbled Pattern**: we fold chunks of three different chocolates into the batter, then drizzle melted versions over the top before swirling. This ensures a complex array of "Snaps" and "Bounces" in every square. By using a full pound of unsweetened chocolate as the base, we provide a deep, bitter anchor that balances the massive amount of sugar and eggs. 

## Directions

1.  **The Melt:** Preheat oven to 300°F. In a large saucepan, melt the butter and unsweetened chocolate over low heat until glossy. Let cool for 10 minutes.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a massive bowl, whisk sugar, eggs, vanilla, and salt until thick and pale. Stir in the melted chocolate.
3.  **Incorporate:** Gradually fold in the flour until **just combined**. Fold in 5 oz each of the chopped bittersweet, white, and milk chocolates.
4.  **Assemble:** Spread the batter into two greased 9x13-inch pans. 
5.  **The Swirl:** Melt the remaining chopped chocolates in separate microwave-safe bowls. Drizzle the three chocolates over the batter and use a knife to create a marbled "High Note" pattern.
6.  **Bake:** Bake for 35-40 minutes until the tops are mirror-shiny and the edges are firm.
7.  **The Set:** Cool **completely** in the pans before slicing into squares. This is mandatory for the structural integrity.
