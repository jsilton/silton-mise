## Chef's Note

This is a 25-minute quick hero. The secret to a rich, non-watery vegan curry is **Textural Balance** through the **Tomato Reduction Method**. We sauté the onions and tomatoes together for 10 minutes _before_ adding the coconut milk—this releases the tomatoes' natural sugars and thickens their juices. The **Acid Balance** from the fresh lime juice is mandatory; it provides the "High Note" that brightens the earthy chickpeas and rich coconut fat.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a deep pot or Dutch oven, heat coconut oil over medium-high. Add onions and tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper.
2.  **Reduce:** Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and the tomato juices have thickened into a jam-like consistency.
3.  **Bloom:** Add the garlic, garam masala, curry powder, and cumin. Stir constantly for 1 minute until fragrant.
4.  **Simmer:** Pour in the coconut milk and chickpeas. If you prefer a thicker sauce, stir in the coconut flour. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer for 10-12 minutes to allow flavors to meld.
5.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Stir in the fresh lime juice and cilantro. Taste and adjust seasoning.
6.  **Serve:** Serve hot over basmati rice with a side of naan.
