## Chef's Note

This quick Thai-inspired vegan curry builds depth by sautéing onions and tomatoes together for 10 minutes before adding coconut milk, allowing the tomatoes' sugars to concentrate and their juices to thicken. Fresh lime juice stirred in at the end brightens the earthy chickpeas and rich coconut.

## Directions

1.  **The Base:** In a deep pot or Dutch oven, heat coconut oil over medium-high. Add onions and tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper.
2.  **Reduce:** Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and the tomato juices have thickened into a jam-like consistency.
3.  **Bloom:** Add the garlic, garam masala, curry powder, and cumin. Stir constantly for 1 minute until fragrant.
4.  **Simmer:** Pour in the coconut milk and chickpeas. If you prefer a thicker sauce, stir in the coconut flour. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer for 10-12 minutes to allow flavors to meld.
5.  **Finish:** Remove from heat. Stir in the fresh lime juice and cilantro. Taste and adjust seasoning.
6.  **Serve:** Serve hot over basmati rice with a side of naan.
