## Chef's Note

This chowder is about **Textural Balance**. Most corn chowders are mushy; we fix this by roasting the corn at high heat first to get "pop" and sweetness. We use the **Bacon Fat** as the base for the onion and garlic to layer the smoky flavor throughout. The finish of fresh lime juice is the "Executive High Note" that cuts the richness of the cream.

## Directions

1.  **Roast Corn:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss corn kernels with a splash of oil and salt. Roast on a sheet pan for 15 minutes until charred and nutty.
2.  **Render:** In a large pot, cook diced bacon over medium heat until crisp. Remove bacon bits to a plate, leaving the fat in the pot.
3.  **Sauté:** Add the red onion and garlic to the bacon fat. Sauté for 5 minutes until soft.
4.  **Simmer:** Add the potatoes, chicken stock, and smoked paprika. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low and simmer for 15-20 minutes until potatoes are tender.
5.  **Cream & Corn:** Stir in the heavy cream and the roasted corn. Use an immersion blender to pulse the soup 3-4 times (you want it creamy but still chunky).
6.  **The Shrimp:** Add the shrimp to the hot liquid. Cook for 2-3 minutes until pink.
7.  **Finish:** Stir in the fresh lime juice and the reserved bacon bits. Taste and adjust salt.
