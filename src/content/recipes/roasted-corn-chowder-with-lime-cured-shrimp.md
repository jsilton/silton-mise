## Chef's Note

This Mexican-inspired corn chowder builds depth by roasting corn kernels at high heat first to develop caramelized sweetness, then using rendered bacon fat as the base for sautéing aromatics. The layers of smoky flavor come through in every spoonful. Fresh lime juice at the end cuts through the richness of the cream.

## Directions

1.  **Roast Corn:** Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss corn kernels with a splash of oil and salt. Roast on a sheet pan for 15 minutes until charred and nutty.
2.  **Render:** In a large pot, cook diced bacon over medium heat until crisp. Remove bacon bits to a plate, leaving the fat in the pot.
3.  **Sauté:** Add the red onion and garlic to the bacon fat. Sauté for 5 minutes until soft.
4.  **Simmer:** Add the potatoes, chicken stock, and smoked paprika. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low and simmer for 15-20 minutes until potatoes are tender.
5.  **Cream & Corn:** Stir in the heavy cream and the roasted corn. Use an immersion blender to pulse the soup 3-4 times (you want it creamy but still chunky).
6.  **The Shrimp:** Add the shrimp to the hot liquid. Cook for 2-3 minutes until pink.
7.  **Finish:** Stir in the fresh lime juice and the reserved bacon bits. Taste and adjust salt.
