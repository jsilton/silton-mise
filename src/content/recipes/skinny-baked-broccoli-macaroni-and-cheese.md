## Chef's Note
This is a high-performance "Fuel" update to the classic side. The secret to its Success is **The Hybrid Stock Emulsion**: by using a mix of skim milk and chicken broth for the sauce, we achieve a rich, savory "Bounce" without the heavy calories of cream. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The Staged Boil**: we cook the pasta and broccoli in the same pot, adding the broccoli during the final 2 minutes. This ensures the florets stay vibrant and "Snappy" rather than dissolving into the sauce.

## Directions

1.  **The Pot:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta. 2 minutes before the pasta is al dente, add the broccoli florets. Drain.
2.  **The Roux:** In a large skillet, melt butter. Sauté onion for 2 minutes. Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute until golden.
3.  **Emulsify:** Slowly whisk in the milk and broth. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 5 minutes until thick. Season with salt and pepper.
4.  **Bind:** Remove from heat. Stir in the cheddar until molten. Fold in the cooked macaroni and broccoli.
5.  **Bake:** Transfer to a greased baking dish. Sprinkle with breadcrumbs and Parmesan.
6.  **Finish:** Bake at 375°F for 15-20 minutes. Broil for 2 minutes until the top is crispy and the cheese is "Snappy."
