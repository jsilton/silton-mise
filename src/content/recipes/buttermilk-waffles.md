## Chef's Note

Buttermilk's acidity reacts with baking soda for extra lift and tang. Rest the batter for 10-15 minutes before cooking so flour fully absorbs the liquid - this produces waffles that are crispy outside and airy inside. The batter should become slightly bubbly during the rest.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
2.  **Wet Mix:** In a separate bowl, whisk the buttermilk and melted butter. Whisk in the eggs until just combined.
3.  **Combine:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Whisk until **just combined**—a few small lumps are essential for a light texture. Fold in the vanilla.
4.  **The Rest:** Let the batter rest at room temperature for 10-15 minutes. It should become slightly bubbly.
5.  **Cook:** Preheat your waffle iron and grease lightly. Pour about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of batter (depending on your iron size).
6.  **Finish:** Cook until the steam stops rising from the iron and the waffles are deep golden brown.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with salted butter, maple syrup, and fresh berries.
