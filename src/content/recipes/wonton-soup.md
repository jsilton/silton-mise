## Chef's Note

Cantonese wonton soup features delicate pork wontons in clear, aromatic broth. Stirring the pork filling vigorously in one direction until it becomes sticky and tacky is a traditional technique that ensures the filling stays cohesive during boiling. Ladling hot broth over aromatics placed in individual bowls preserves their fresh fragrance.

## Directions

1.  **The Filling:** In a large bowl, whisk pork, scallions, ginger, soy, wine, and broth in one direction until sticky.
2.  **Assemble:** Place 1 tsp filling in the center of a wrapper. Wet the edges with water. Fold into a rectangle, then pinch the two corners together to form a "hat."
3.  **The Base:** In 4 serving bowls, add a drop of sesame oil, white pepper, and a pinch of salt.
4.  **Boil:** In a large pot of water, boil wontons for 3-4 minutes until they float. During the final 20 seconds, add the bok choy.
5.  **Bind:** Heat the [Wonton Broth](/silton-mise/recipes/cantonese-wonton-broth) to boiling. Ladle the hot broth into the serving bowls.
6.  **Serve:** Transfer the wontons and bok choy to the bowls. Garnish with scallions and chili oil for the final **High Note**.
