## Chef's Note
The secret to wontons that float like clouds is **Structural Science** through **The Directional Emulsion Pattern**. You must stir the pork and liquid seasonings in **one direction only** for 3 minutes until the meat turns into a sticky, tacky paste; this ensures the filling has a resilient "Bounce" that won't crumble. We use **The Heated-Bowl Pattern**: adding the hot broth to the raw seasonings in each individual bowl just before adding the wontons—this provides a fresh, aromatic **High Note** that is lost in a large boiling pot.

## Directions

1.  **The Filling:** In a large bowl, whisk pork, scallions, ginger, soy, wine, and broth in one direction until sticky.
2.  **Assemble:** Place 1 tsp filling in the center of a wrapper. Wet the edges with water. Fold into a rectangle, then pinch the two corners together to form a "hat."
3.  **The Base:** In 4 serving bowls, add a drop of sesame oil, white pepper, and a pinch of salt. 
4.  **Boil:** In a large pot of water, boil wontons for 3-4 minutes until they float. During the final 20 seconds, add the bok choy.
5.  **Bind:** Heat the [Wonton Broth](/recipes/cantonese-wonton-broth) to boiling. Ladle the hot broth into the serving bowls. 
6.  **Serve:** Transfer the wontons and bok choy to the bowls. Garnish with scallions and chili oil for the final **High Note**.
