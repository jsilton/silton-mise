## Chef's Note

These are essentially "Pancakes in a Pan." The secret to their fluffy, rich texture is the **Cottage Cheese Emulsion**: when blended, the cottage cheese acts as a high-protein fat source that creates a souffle-like lift in the oven. This is a perfect "Survival" breakfast for busy mornings.

## Directions

1.  **Emulsify:** In a blender, combine bananas, oats, cottage cheese, eggs, syrup, and vanilla. Process until completely smooth.
2.  **Portion:** Pour the batter into a greased 12-cup muffin tin.
3.  **Top:** Press 4-5 blueberries into the top of each muffin.
4.  **Bake:** Bake at 350°F for 25-30 minutes until they are puffed and golden.
5.  **Cool:** Let sit for 5 minutes before removing.
