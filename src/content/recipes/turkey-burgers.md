## Chef's Note

The challenge with turkey burgers is preventing them from turning into dry, flavorless hockey pucks. We solve this with two techniques: **The Panade** (mixing breadcrumbs and milk) which creates a moisture reservoir inside the meat, and **Gentle Handling** (don't over-mix or the protein gets tough). For the best results, pull the burgers off the grill or skillet at 160°F and let them carry-over to 165°F.

## Directions

1.  **The Panade:** In a large bowl, whisk the panko and milk together until a paste forms.
2.  **The Mix:** Add the ground turkey, Worcestershire, BBQ sauce, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Use your hands to gently mix until just combined. **Do not overwork the meat.**
3.  **Shape:** Divide into 4 equal portions and shape into patties about 1/2-inch wider than your buns. Press a small indent into the center of each patty with your thumb (this prevents the "burger bulge" while cooking).
4.  **Sear:** Heat a grill or heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Lightly oil the surface.
5.  **Cook:** Grill or sear the patties for 4-5 minutes per side. If using cheese, add it in the last 60 seconds and cover the pan to melt.
6.  **Assemble:** Build the burgers on toasted buns with spinach, sliced avocado, and red onion.
