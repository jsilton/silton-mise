## Chef's Note

This is a simple Italian vegetable pasta that showcases the classic technique of using starchy pasta water as a sauce base. Southern Italians have been making versions of this for generations with whatever vegetables are in season. The key is adding the broccoli to the boiling pasta water in the last 2 minutes so it stays bright green and slightly crisp - not overcooked and gray. The pasta water's starch binds with the olive oil and Parmesan to create a light, clingy sauce without heavy cream. Lemon zest (not just juice) is essential for brightness. This is the kind of simple, economical pasta working-class Italian families made nightly.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook for 8 minutes.
2.  **Stage 2:** 2 minutes before the pasta is done, add the broccoli florets to the same pot.
3.  **The Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, Parmesan, lemon juice, and zest.
4.  **Drain:** **Reserve 1 cup of pasta water**, then drain the pasta and broccoli.
5.  **Bind:** Return pasta and broccoli to the pot. Add the peas and the lemon-Parmesan mixture.
6.  **Emulsify:** Add the reserved pasta water 1/4 cup at a time, tossing vigorously over low heat until the sauce is glossy and the peas are bright.
7.  **Serve:** Season with salt and plenty of black pepper. Top with extra Parmesan.
