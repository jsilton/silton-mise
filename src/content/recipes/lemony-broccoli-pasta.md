## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate 20-minute quick hero. The secret to its Success is **The Starch-Bind Emulsion Method**: we use the hot, starchy pasta water to emulsify the olive oil and Parmesan into a light, silky glaze that clings to the noodles. We maintain **Textural Balance** by adding the broccoli to the pasta pot during the final 2 minutes; this ensures it is vibrant green and crispy rather than boiled into mush. The lemon zest provides the mandatory aromatic **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook for 8 minutes.
2.  **Stage 2:** 2 minutes before the pasta is done, add the broccoli florets to the same pot.
3.  **The Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, Parmesan, lemon juice, and zest.
4.  **Drain:** **Reserve 1 cup of pasta water**, then drain the pasta and broccoli.
5.  **Bind:** Return pasta and broccoli to the pot. Add the peas and the lemon-Parmesan mixture.
6.  **Emulsify:** Add the reserved pasta water 1/4 cup at a time, tossing vigorously over low heat until the sauce is glossy and the peas are bright.
7.  **Serve:** Season with salt and plenty of black pepper. Top with extra Parmesan.
