## Directions

1. Prepare shrimp: preheat oven to 425°. Pat the shrimp dry with a paper towel before transferring them to a large bowl. Add oil, lime juice, garlic, chili powder, cumin, cayenne (if using), and salt. Let shrimp marinate for at least 15 minutes.
2. For slaw: Combine cabbage, cilantro, oil, lime juice, and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl. Move slaw to the fridge while you prepare tacos.
3. Add onions to ⅓ of the sheet pan and toss with 1 tablespoon of oil and 1 tbsp water. Add pineapple to the next ⅓ and toss in 1 tablespoon of oil. Finally, add shrimp to remaining ⅓ of the pan in an even layer. Roast until shrimp is cooked through, about 12 - 15 minutes.
4. To assemble tacos, lay down a layer of slaw in a tortilla, then add a mixture of shrimp, onions, and pineapple and top with cilantro, avocado, sour cream, and radish, if using.
