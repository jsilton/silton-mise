## Chef's Note
The secret to this 30-minute "Speed" meal is **The Zone-Roast Pattern**. Instead of tossing everything together, we divide the sheet pan into three distinct zones: shrimp, pineapple, and onions. This allows the pineapple sugars to caramelize into a "Snap" without turning the shrimp soggy. We use **Texture Integrity** in the slaw: by slicing the cabbage paper-thin and dressing it only at the moment of serving, we provide a watery, crunchy contrast to the sticky, sweet shrimp. The lime juice provides the mandatory **Acid Finish**.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** In a large bowl, whisk oil, lime juice, garlic, and all spices. Add shrimp and **let stand for 15 minutes**.
2.  **The Pan:** Preheat oven to 425°F. On a large sheet pan, place onions in one zone, pineapple in the second, and the marinated shrimp in the third.
3.  **Roast:** Bake for 12-15 minutes until the shrimp are pink and the pineapple edges are browned.
4.  **The Slaw:** While the pan roasts, toss cabbage and cilantro with lime juice and salt. Refrigerate until stone-cold.
5.  **Assemble:** Warm tortillas. Place a handful of cold slaw in each. Top with 3-4 shrimp and several pieces of roasted onion and pineapple.
6.  **Finish:** Top with avocado and sour cream for the final aromatic **High Note**.
