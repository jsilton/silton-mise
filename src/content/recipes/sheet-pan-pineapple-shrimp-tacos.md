## Chef's Note

These Mexican-inspired shrimp tacos roast on a divided sheet pan where shrimp, pineapple, and onions cook in separate zones, allowing the pineapple's sugars to caramelize without making the shrimp soggy. A cold cabbage-cilantro slaw dressed at the last moment provides crisp contrast to the sweet, sticky shrimp. Lime juice adds brightness.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** In a large bowl, whisk oil, lime juice, garlic, and all spices. Add shrimp and **let stand for 15 minutes**.
2.  **The Pan:** Preheat oven to 425°F. On a large sheet pan, place onions in one zone, pineapple in the second, and the marinated shrimp in the third.
3.  **Roast:** Bake for 12-15 minutes until the shrimp are pink and the pineapple edges are browned.
4.  **The Slaw:** While the pan roasts, toss cabbage and cilantro with lime juice and salt. Refrigerate until stone-cold.
5.  **Assemble:** Warm tortillas. Place a handful of cold slaw in each. Top with 3-4 shrimp and several pieces of roasted onion and pineapple.
6.  **Finish:** Top with avocado and sour cream for the final aromatic **High Note**.
