## Chef's Note

This is the baseline **Modularity** component for all Executive breakfasts. The secret to "Kitchen Standard" clusters is **Culinary Technique** through **The Syrup Bind Method**: we whisk the oil and maple syrup into a stable emulsion before pouring over the oats—this ensures every grain is coated in a thin "guard" that caramelizes in the oven. We maintain **Textural Balance** by using a **Three-Stage Bake**: we roast at 350°F and stir twice to ensure even browning, but we only add the dried fruit _after_ the granola has cooled to prevent it from turning into rock-hard bullets.

## Directions

1.  **Dry Mix:** Preheat oven to 350°F. In a large bowl, toss together oats, nuts, and seeds.
2.  **The Emulsion:** In a separate jar or bowl, whisk together the oil, maple syrup, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt until smooth and uniform.
3.  **Combine:** Pour the liquid emulsion over the dry mix. Toss with a spatula until the oats look dark and saturated.
4.  **The Roast:** Spread the mixture in a thin, even layer on a large rimmed baking sheet.
5.  **Stir:** Bake for 20-25 minutes. **Stir the granola every 8 minutes** to ensure the edges don't burn and the center gets crispy.
6.  **The Finish:** Remove from the oven when deep golden brown. The granola will still feel soft; it will Crunch only after cooling.
7.  **Finish:** Once stone-cold, stir in the dried fruit. Store in an airtight glass jar for up to 3 weeks.
