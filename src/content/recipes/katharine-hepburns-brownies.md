## Chef's Note

This is the classic Katharine Hepburn brownie recipe. The secret to its fudgy texture is the ultra-low flour ratio: using only 1/4 cup of flour ensures the structure remains gooey and fudge-like rather than cakey. We melt the cocoa directly into the hot butter to bloom the chocolate flavor instantly. Large nut pieces provide a necessary crunch to contrast the decadent fudge. Do not over-bake; pull them when they still look slightly underdone.

## Directions

1.  **The Bloom:** Preheat oven to 325°F. Grease an 8x8-inch square pan. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Whisk in the cocoa powder until smooth and glossy. Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes.
2.  **Emulsify:** Whisk the eggs into the cocoa-butter mixture one at a time. Stir in the vanilla and salt.
3.  **The Fold:** In a separate bowl, whisk the sugar and flour. Add the dry mix and the nuts to the saucepan. Stir with a spatula until **just combined**.
4.  **Bake:** Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 30-35 minutes. **The Kitchen Standard Test:** The center should still have a slight jiggle and a toothpick should come out with moist crumbs.
5.  **Cool:** Let cool completely in the pan before slicing. These brownies are elite when refrigerated and eaten cold.
