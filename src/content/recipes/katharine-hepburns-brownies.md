## Chef's Note

This is the ultimate expression of **Updated Classic** in the brownie category. The secret to the Hepburn Standard is the **Ultra-Low Flour Ratio**: using only 1/4 cup of flour ensures the structure remains "Gooey" and fudge-like rather than cakey. We use **The Saucepan Melt Method**: melting the cocoa directly into the hot butter "blooms" the chocolate intensity instantly. We maintain **Textural Balance** by using large nut pieces, which provide a necessary Crunch to contrast the decadent Texture of the fudge. Do not over-bake; pull them when they still look slightly underdone.

## Directions

1.  **The Bloom:** Preheat oven to 325°F. Grease an 8x8-inch square pan. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Whisk in the cocoa powder until smooth and glossy. Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes.
2.  **Emulsify:** Whisk the eggs into the cocoa-butter mixture one at a time. Stir in the vanilla and salt.
3.  **The Fold:** In a separate bowl, whisk the sugar and flour. Add the dry mix and the nuts to the saucepan. Stir with a spatula until **just combined**.
4.  **Bake:** Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 30-35 minutes. **The Kitchen Standard Test:** The center should still have a slight jiggle and a toothpick should come out with moist crumbs.
5.  **Cool:** Let cool completely in the pan before slicing. These brownies are elite when refrigerated and eaten cold.
