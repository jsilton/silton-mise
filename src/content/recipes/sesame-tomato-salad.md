## Chef's Note

This salad is a study in **Modularity** and flavor layering. The secret to its Success is **The Sesame Emulsion Method**: we whisk toasted sesame oil into a traditional vinaigrette base to introduce a nutty, roasted depth that contrasts the sweet, watery tomatoes. We maintain **Textural Balance** by using a mix of heirloom varieties—the varying firmness of each tomato provides a spectrum of "Snaps" and "Bounces." The soy sauce acts as the primary salt source, introducing an umami backbone that defines the dish.

## Directions

1.  **The Dressing:** In a small jar, whisk together the olive oil, sesame oil, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and sugar until completely emulsified and opaque.
2.  **Prep:** Arrange the tomatoes on a large, shallow platter (layering them too deep will crush the bottom pieces).
3.  **Bind:** Drizzle half of the dressing over the tomatoes. Let stand for 5 minutes—this allows the tomatoes to release their juices and mix with the emulsion.
4.  **Finish:** Top with fresh basil, flaky sea salt, and a crack of black pepper.
5.  **Serve:** Serve the remaining dressing on the side for the mandatory **High Note** of freshness.
