## Chef's Note

This is a "Updated Classic" upgrade of a family staple. By swapping margarine for **Butter** and using **Boiling Water**, we bloom the cocoa powder to its full potential. The secret to this cake is the **One-Pot Method**: you mix the entire batter in the saucepan used to melt the butter, ensuring minimal clean-up. Always frost the cake while it is still warm to create that signature, fudgy seal.

## Directions

1.  **Melt & Bloom:** In a large saucepan over medium heat, bring the butter, cocoa powder, and water to a gentle boil. Remove from heat immediately.
2.  **The Batter:** Into the hot saucepan, whisk in the sugar, buttermilk, baking soda, salt, and eggs until smooth. Gradually fold in the flour and vanilla.
3.  **Bake:** Pour the batter into a greased 9x13 rectangular pan (or two 8-inch squares). Bake at 350°F for 25-30 minutes until a tester comes out clean.
4.  **The Frosting:** While the cake bakes, melt the 1 stick of butter in a clean saucepan. Whisk in the cocoa and milk. Remove from heat and stir in the powdered sugar until silky.
5.  **Seal:** Pour the warm frosting over the hot cake immediately after removing it from the oven. Let cool completely (if you can wait!) before slicing.
