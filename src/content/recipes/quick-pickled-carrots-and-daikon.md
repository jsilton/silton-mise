## Chef's Note

This is the essential "acid crunch" for Banh Mi and Vietnamese bowls. The secret is the **Salt Massage**: by tossing the raw veg with salt and sugar first, you draw out the moisture and soften the crunch slightly, allowing the vinegar to penetrate deeply.

## Directions

1.  **Massage:** In a bowl, toss the carrots and daikon with the salt and sugar. Use your hands to massage the vegetables for 2-3 minutes until they are limp and have released some water.
2.  **Rinse:** Rinse the vegetables under cold water and squeeze them bone-dry.
3.  **Pickle:** Place the vegetables in a jar. Pour the rice vinegar and water over them.
4.  **Rest:** Let sit for at least 30 minutes (or up to a week in the fridge).
