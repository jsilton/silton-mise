## Chef's Note

This is our tribute to an Atlanta heritage favorite. The secret to "Restaurant Quality" lo mein is the **Lo Mein Emulsion Pattern**. Instead of just tossing noodles in cold sauce, we simmer the sauce with the vegetables until it reduces by half, creating a thick, glossy glaze that has enough "Bounce" to fully coat every strand of noodle. We maintain **Texture Integrity** by searing the chicken quickly and removing it—this ensures the breast meat stays succulent while the vegetables caramelize.

## Directions

1.  **The Sauce:** Whisk together soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, oyster sauce, and sugar until dissolved. Set aside.
2.  **The Sear:** Heat a wok over high heat until smoking. Add 1 tbsp oil. Sear chicken for 3 minutes until just cooked through. Remove chicken and set aside.
3.  **Aromatics:** Add garlic and ginger to the wok. Sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant.
4.  **Caramelize:** Add onions, carrots, and cabbage. Sauté for 4 minutes until the vegetables are tender and starting to brown at the edges.
5.  **The Reduction:** Pour the Cantonese sauce into the wok. Add the cooked noodles and edamame.
6.  **Bind:** Return the chicken to the wok. Toss vigorously over high heat for 3 minutes until the sauce has reduced by half and is clinging to the noodles in a glossy film.
7.  **Serve:** Divide into bowls and garnish with scallions for the mandatory **High Note**.
