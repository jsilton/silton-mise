## Chef's Note

The secret to elite wontons is **Structural Science** through **The Directional Stir Pattern**. You must mix the pork and shrimp in **one direction only** until the proteins emulsify into a sticky, tacky paste; this ensures the filling has a resilient "Bounce" rather than crumbling like a meatball. We maintain **Texture Integrity** by using our [Cantonese Wonton Broth](/recipes/cantonese-wonton-broth)—the addition of shredded nori and sesame oil at the very end provides the mandatory aromatic **High Note**.

## Directions

1.  **The Filling:** In a large bowl, combine pork, shrimp, ginger, scallions, and all seasonings. Stir vigorously in one direction for 3 minutes until sticky.
2.  **Assemble:** Place 1 tsp filling in the center of a [Wonton Wrapper](/recipes/fresh-wonton-wrappers). Dab edges with water, fold into a triangle, and pinch the corners together.
3.  **The Base:** In serving bowls, add a drop of sesame oil, 1 tsp soy sauce, and shredded nori.
4.  **Boil:** Bring a pot of [Wonton Broth](/recipes/cantonese-wonton-broth) to a boil. Add the wontons. Cook for 3-4 minutes until they float. During the final 1 minute, add the greens.
5.  **Bind:** Ladle 1 cup of the boiling broth into each serving bowl to "wake up" the seasonings.
6.  **Serve:** Transfer wontons and greens to the bowls. Garnish with fresh coriander and serve immediately.
