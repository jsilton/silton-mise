## Chef's Note

Char Siu (叉烧) literally means "fork roasted," referring to the traditional method of skewering the meat. The signature is the balance of sweet and savory, with a sticky, caramelized exterior that comes from repeated basting. This recipe adheres to the traditional Cantonese technique of high heat to char the outside, but uses a water bath in the oven to keep the pork butt juicy. 

**Kitchen Context:** If using tenderloin (leaner), reduce cooking time by 10-15 minutes to prevent drying out. Pork Butt is forgiving and preferred for its fat content which renders into the sauce.

## Directions

1.  **Marinate:** Whisk all marinade ingredients together. Cut pork into long strips approx 2-3 inches thick. Massage marinade into the meat. Reserve 2-3 tbsp of marinade for the glaze later. Refrigerate pork for at least 8 hours (ideally overnight).
2.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 475°F. Line a baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack on top. Pour 1 cup of water into the bottom of the pan (under the rack) to create humidity and prevent smoke.
3.  **Roast (High Heat):** Place pork on the rack, ensuring space between strips. Roast at 475°F for 10 minutes to set the crust.
4.  **Roast (Low Heat):** Reduce oven to 375°F. Flip the meat. Roast for 30-40 minutes more.
5.  **The Glaze:** Every 10 minutes, brush the pork with the reserved marinade (or pan drippings if safe).
6.  **Broil (The Char):** For the signature blackened edges, switch on the broiler for the final 2-3 minutes. Watch closely—sugar burns instantly.
7.  **Rest:** Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.
