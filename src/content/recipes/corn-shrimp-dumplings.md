## Chef's Note
This is a sophisticated "Project" meal that relies on **Structural Science** for its elite mouthfeel. To achieve the "Restaurant Bounce," you must stir the shrimp mixture vigorously in one direction for 2 minutes before adding the corn; this emulsifies the proteins into a sticky paste. We maintain **Texture Integrity** by using fresh corn kernels, which provide a sweet "Snap" that contrasts with the savory shrimp.

## Directions

1.  **The Paste:** In a large bowl, combine the chopped shrimp, scallions, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, and white pepper. Stir **vigorously in one direction** for 2 minutes until the mixture is sticky and pale.
2.  **Add Snap:** Fold in the fresh corn kernels.
3.  **Shape:** Place a wrapper in your palm. Spoon 1 tbsp of filling into the center. Moisten the edges with water. Fold into a half-moon and pleat the edges to seal tightly.
4.  **Steam:** Place in a bamboo steamer lined with parchment. Steam over boiling water for 4-5 minutes until the internal temp is 165°F and the wrappers are translucent.
5.  **Option (Boil):** Alternatively, drop into boiling water for 3 minutes until they float.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with a side of soy sauce and [Quick Pickled Red Onions](/recipes/pickled-red-onions) or chili oil.
