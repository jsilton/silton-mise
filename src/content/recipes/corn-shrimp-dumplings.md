## Chef's Note

Corn and shrimp dumplings are a modern dim sum creation showcasing summer sweetness. The key to bouncy texture: stir the shrimp mixture vigorously in one direction for 2 minutes before adding the corn. This develops the protein structure that gives the filling its characteristic snap. Fresh corn kernels provide sweet crunch that contrasts beautifully with the savory shrimp. These freeze well for make-ahead entertaining.

## Directions

1.  **The Paste:** In a large bowl, combine the chopped shrimp, scallions, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, and white pepper. Stir **vigorously in one direction** for 2 minutes until the mixture is sticky and pale.
2.  **Add Snap:** Fold in the fresh corn kernels.
3.  **Shape:** Place a wrapper in your palm. Spoon 1 tbsp of filling into the center. Moisten the edges with water. Fold into a half-moon and pleat the edges to seal tightly.
4.  **Steam:** Place in a bamboo steamer lined with parchment. Steam over boiling water for 4-5 minutes until the internal temp is 165°F and the wrappers are translucent.
5.  **Option (Boil):** Alternatively, drop into boiling water for 3 minutes until they float.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with a side of soy sauce and [quick Pickled Red Onions](/mise/recipes/pickled-red-onions) or chili oil.
