## Chef's Note

Kongnamul namul (seasoned soybean sprouts) is a staple banchan (side dish) in Korean cuisine, often served with bibimbap or alongside grilled meats. Cooking sprouts in a small amount of water with the lid tightly closed steams them while preserving their crisp texture and nutty aroma. Tossing the warm sprouts with toasted sesame oil allows the oil to emulsify with residual moisture for a glossy, savory finish.

## Directions

1.  **Steam:** In a medium pot, combine 1/2 cup water, a pinch of salt, and the sprouts. Cover tightly.
2.  **Cook:** Steam over medium-high for 4-5 minutes. **Do not open the lid** until the timer is up (mandatory for aroma).
3.  **Drain:** Drain the sprouts and let them stand for 2 minutes to release steam.
4.  **Season:** In a large bowl, whisk together sesame oil, garlic, salt, and green onion.
5.  **Bind:** Add the warm sprouts. Toss vigorously with your hands or tongs until every strand is coated.
6.  **Serve:** Garnish with sesame seeds. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
