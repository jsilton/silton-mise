## Chef's Note

This is a baseline **Modularity** component for all Korean nutritious meals. The secret to its Success is **The Steam-Lock Method**: we cook the sprouts in a very small amount of water with the lid tightly closed; this ensures the sprouts maintain their resilient Crunch and nutty aroma rather than turning soggy. We use **Toasted Sesame Oil** as the mandatory savory **High Note**—tossing the sprouts while warm ensures the oil emulsifies with the residual moisture for a perfect glossy finish.

## Directions

1.  **Steam:** In a medium pot, combine 1/2 cup water, a pinch of salt, and the sprouts. Cover tightly.
2.  **Cook:** Steam over medium-high for 4-5 minutes. **Do not open the lid** until the timer is up (mandatory for aroma).
3.  **Drain:** Drain the sprouts and let them stand for 2 minutes to release steam.
4.  **Season:** In a large bowl, whisk together sesame oil, garlic, salt, and green onion.
5.  **Bind:** Add the warm sprouts. Toss vigorously with your hands or tongs until every strand is coated.
6.  **Serve:** Garnish with sesame seeds. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
