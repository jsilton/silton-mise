## Chef's Note

This cake creates striking visual swirls. The key to the interior pattern is alternating pours of white and chocolate batter directly into the center of the pan, which creates a precise bulls-eye that transforms into elegant swirls as it bakes. We use a mix of cake flour and all-purpose flour—the crumb is tender enough for a layer cake but sturdy enough to support the weight of the rich dark chocolate ganache.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 325°F. Butter and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.
2.  **Dry Mix:** Whisk together both flours, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
3.  **Cream:** Beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy (5 mins). Add eggs one at a time, followed by vanilla.
4.  **Combine:** Alternately add the dry mix and whole milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Stir until **just combined**.
5.  **Split:** Divide the batter into two bowls. Into one bowl, whisk in the cocoa powder and 2 extra tbsp of milk.
6.  **The Swirl:** Pour 1/3 cup white batter into the center of each pan. Pour 1/3 cup chocolate batter directly onto the center of the white batter. Repeat until all batter is used.
7.  **Bake:** Bake for 35 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes, then transfer to racks.
8.  **The Ganache:** Heat cream until just boiling. Pour over chopped chocolate. Let sit for 5 minutes, then whisk until glossy. Let cool until thickened to a spreading consistency.
9.  **Assemble:** Level the cooled cakes. Layer with ganache and frost the top and sides. Refrigerate for 1 hour to set the Texture before slicing.
