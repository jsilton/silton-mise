## Chef's Note

Canned beans are a survival staple, but they need **Flavor Layering** to be restaurant-worthy. We use the bean liquid (aquafaba) to create a natural, creamy sauce and bloom the cumin in oil first to wake up the earthy spices. The final hit of **Lime Juice** is the mandatory Executive acid finish.

## Directions

1.  **Bloom:** Heat oil in a small pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and cumin. Stir for 30 seconds until fragrant.
2.  **Simmer:** Pour in the beans (including their liquid). Add the oregano.
3.  **Mash:** Simmer gently for 8-10 minutes. Use the back of a spoon to mash about 10% of the beans against the side of the pot—this thickens the liquid into a rich gravy.
4.  **Finish:** Stir in the lime juice. Season with salt and pepper.
