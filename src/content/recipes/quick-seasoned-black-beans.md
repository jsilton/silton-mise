## Chef's Note

This Mexican-style quick black bean side transforms canned beans by blooming cumin in oil to release its aromatic oils, then simmering the beans in their own liquid (aquafaba) to create a naturally creamy sauce. Mashing about 10% of the beans thickens the liquid into a rich consistency. A splash of lime juice at the end brightens the earthy flavors.

## Directions

1.  **Bloom:** Heat oil in a small pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and cumin. Stir for 30 seconds until fragrant.
2.  **Simmer:** Pour in the beans (including their liquid). Add the oregano.
3.  **Mash:** Simmer gently for 8-10 minutes. Use the back of a spoon to mash about 10% of the beans against the side of the pot—this thickens the liquid into a rich gravy.
4.  **Finish:** Stir in the lime juice. Season with salt and pepper.
