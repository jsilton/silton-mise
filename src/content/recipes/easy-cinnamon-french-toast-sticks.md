## Chef's Note

Slightly stale bread acts like a sponge for custard without falling apart - fresh bread becomes too soggy. Cook in foaming butter over medium heat, rotating to caramelize all four sides of each stick. Don't over-soak the bread.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Cut each slice of Texas toast into 4 uniform sticks. Set aside.
2.  **The Custard:** In a large wide bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, cinnamon, honey, and vanilla until no streaks of egg remain.
3.  **The Soak:** Working in batches, dip each bread stick into the custard. Rotate to coat all 4 sides. **Do not over-soak**—you want the custard to penetrate 1/4 inch into the bread, not turn the core into mush.
4.  **The Sear:** Heat a large skillet over medium. Add 2 tbsp butter. Once foaming, add the sticks in a single layer (do not crowd).
5.  **Rotate:** Cook for 2 minutes per side, rotating until all four sides are deep golden brown and slightly crispy.
6.  **Serve:** Serve hot with a side of warm maple syrup for dipping and fresh berries.
