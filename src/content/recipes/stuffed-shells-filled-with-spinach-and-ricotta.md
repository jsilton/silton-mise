## Chef's Note

Stuffed shells (conchiglioni ripieni) are a classic Italian-American "pasta al forno" (baked pasta) dish that became popular in the 1950s-70s. In Italy, similar preparations exist but are more regional - this Americanized version is designed for easy assembly and feeding a crowd. The critical step is squeezing the blanched spinach bone-dry in a kitchen towel - any excess water will make the filling weep and the dish watery. Blanch the spinach for only 20 seconds, just until wilted, then shock in ice water to stop cooking and preserve the green color. The egg in the filling acts as a binder to hold everything together. These can be assembled a day ahead, refrigerated, and baked when needed.

## Directions

1.  **Blanch:** Boil spinach for 20 seconds. Shock in ice water. Squeeze until **completely dry**.
2.  **The Filling:** In a food processor, pulse garlic and the dry spinach until finely chopped. Add ricotta, egg, 1/3 cup Parmesan, chives, and salt. Pulse until perfectly smooth and thick.
3.  **Boil Shells:** Cook jumbo shells in salted water for 10 minutes until **al dente**. Drain and toss with olive oil to prevent sticking.
4.  **Assemble:** Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread a thin layer of sauce on the bottom.
5.  **Fill:** Stuff each shell with a rounded tablespoon of the ricotta mix. Arrange in a single layer.
6.  **Bake:** Top with remaining sauce and cover tightly with foil. Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes.
7.  **The Crunch:** Remove foil. Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan. Broil for 2 minutes until the edges are crispy and golden.
