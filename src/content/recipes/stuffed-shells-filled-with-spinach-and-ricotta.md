## Chef's Note

The secret to stuffed shells that aren't watery is **Culinary Technique** through **The Ice-Shock Squeeze Method**. You must blanch the spinach for only 20 seconds and then squeeze it in a towel until **bone-dry** before pureeing with the cheese. This ensures the filling has a dense, custardy Texture rather than weeping into the sauce. We use **The Single-Layer Method**: arranging the shells in a tight, single layer ensures the edges develop a crispy golden crust under the broiler.

## Directions

1.  **Blanch:** Boil spinach for 20 seconds. Shock in ice water. Squeeze until **completely dry**.
2.  **The Filling:** In a food processor, pulse garlic and the dry spinach until finely chopped. Add ricotta, egg, 1/3 cup Parmesan, chives, and salt. Pulse until perfectly smooth and thick.
3.  **Boil Shells:** Cook jumbo shells in salted water for 10 minutes until **al dente**. Drain and toss with olive oil to prevent sticking.
4.  **Assemble:** Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread a thin layer of sauce on the bottom.
5.  **Fill:** Stuff each shell with a rounded tablespoon of the ricotta mix. Arrange in a single layer.
6.  **Bake:** Top with remaining sauce and cover tightly with foil. Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes.
7.  **The Crunch:** Remove foil. Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan. Broil for 2 minutes until the edges are crispy and golden.
