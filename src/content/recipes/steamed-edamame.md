## Chef's Note

Edamame is the ultimate low-effort side dish—frozen pods go straight to the pot, and five minutes later you have a protein-rich snack that pairs with almost any Asian main. The key is generous salting while still warm so the crystals stick to the fuzzy pods. Don't skip the flaky salt; fine table salt slides right off and doesn't deliver that satisfying crunch.

## Directions

1. **The Boil:** Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add frozen edamame and cook for 4-5 minutes until bright green and tender.

2. **The Drain:** Drain well in a colander, shaking off excess water.

3. **The Season:** Transfer to a serving bowl while still hot. Drizzle with sesame oil if using, then sprinkle generously with flaky salt and red pepper flakes.

4. **The Serve:** Serve immediately. Eat by squeezing pods to pop beans into your mouth—discard the pods.
