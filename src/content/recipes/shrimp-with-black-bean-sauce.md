## Chef's Note

The secret to authentic "Lobster Sauce" style shrimp is **Culinary Technique** through **The Egg Ribbon Method**. You must pour the beaten egg slowly across the surface of the boiling sauce and let it sit for 10 seconds before folding; this creates long, silken ribbons that provide a velvety "Bounce." We maintain **Textural Balance** through **The Pork-Bean Sear**: we fry the ground pork and mashed black beans first to develop a smoky, savory foundation that contrasts the sweet Crunch of the shrimp.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Rinse black beans and mash slightly. Whisk stock, oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sesame oil.
2.  **The Render:** In a hot wok, boil the ground pork for 1 minute until no longer pink. Drain and set aside. (This ensures a clean, non-cloudy sauce).
3.  **The Sear:** Heat 2 tbsp oil. Sauté garlic, ginger, peppers, black beans, and the cooked pork for 30 seconds. Add shrimp and Shaoxing wine. Stir-fry for 30 seconds.
4.  **Simmer:** Pour in the stock mixture. Bring to a rapid boil.
5.  **Bind:** Stir in the cornstarch slurry until the sauce is thick and mirror-glossy.
6.  **The Ribbon:** Turn heat to low. Pour the egg across the surface. Let sit for 10 seconds, then fold once.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with scallions and serve immediately over steamed jasmine rice.
