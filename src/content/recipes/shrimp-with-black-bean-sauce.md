## Chef's Note

This Cantonese dish builds flavor from fermented black beans (douchi), which provide a pungent, earthy base when fried with ground pork. Drizzling beaten egg across the surface of the hot sauce and letting it set before folding creates the characteristic silky ribbons found in classic lobster-style sauces popular in Chinese-American restaurants.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Rinse black beans and mash slightly. Whisk stock, oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sesame oil.
2.  **The Render:** In a hot wok, boil the ground pork for 1 minute until no longer pink. Drain and set aside. (This ensures a clean, non-cloudy sauce).
3.  **The Sear:** Heat 2 tbsp oil. Sauté garlic, ginger, peppers, black beans, and the cooked pork for 30 seconds. Add shrimp and Shaoxing wine. Stir-fry for 30 seconds.
4.  **Simmer:** Pour in the stock mixture. Bring to a rapid boil.
5.  **Bind:** Stir in the cornstarch slurry until the sauce is thick and mirror-glossy.
6.  **The Ribbon:** Turn heat to low. Pour the egg across the surface. Let sit for 10 seconds, then fold once.
7.  **Serve:** Garnish with scallions and serve immediately over steamed jasmine rice.
