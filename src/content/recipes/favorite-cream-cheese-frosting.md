## Chef's Note
This is our baseline **Modularity** component for all elite cakes. The secret to a "Gold Standard" frosting that isn't runny is **Structural Science** through **The Temperature Pattern**. Both the butter and cream cheese must be **softened to the same temperature** before starting; this ensures they emulsify perfectly into a stable "Bounce." We use the **Paddle Attachment** rather than a whisk to incorporate the sugar; this provides a dense, silky texture without introducing too many air bubbles, which would cause the frosting to "weep" over time.

## Directions

1.  **Cream:** In a large bowl using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter on high speed for exactly 2 minutes until perfectly smooth and creamy.
2.  **Incorporate:** Reduce speed to low. Add 3 cups of confectioners’ sugar, vanilla, and salt. 
3.  **Aeration:** Once the sugar is mostly mixed in, switch to high speed and beat for 2-3 minutes. The frosting should be light, fluffy, and hold a stiff peak.
4.  **Adjust:** If you prefer a thicker consistency for piping, add the additional 1/4 cup of sugar.
5.  **Store:** Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 5 days. If chilled, let sit at room temp for 30 minutes and beat briefly before using to restore the "Bounce."
