## Chef's Note

This is a 35-minute quick hero. The secret to tofu that isn't soggy is **Textural Balance** through **The Honey-Heat Bind Method**. We toss the tofu in honey and hot sauce _before_ the cornstarch; this creates a sticky surface that the starch and sesame seeds can fuse to, creating a shatteringly crisp Crunch that lasts even after being glazed. The **Dark Soy Sauce** is essential for the mandatory deep amber color of a "Kitchen Standard" General Tso.

## Directions

1.  **The Bind:** Toss dry tofu cubes with honey and hot sauce. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and 3 tbsp cornstarch. Toss until every cube is "crusty."
2.  **The Fry:** Heat oil in a cast-iron skillet until 350°F. Fry tofu in a single layer for 4-5 minutes, turning once, until golden and very crisp. Remove to a sheet pan.
3.  **The Aromatics:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok. Sauté ginger, garlic, and dried chilies for 30 seconds. Add bell peppers and a splash of Shaoxing wine (if using).
4.  **The Simmer:** Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Add the broccoli.
5.  **The Glaze:** Immediately add the soy sauces, vinegar, sugar, and sesame oil. Stir in the cornstarch slurry.
6.  **Bind:** Simmer for 1 minute until the sauce is thick and mirror-glossy.
7.  **Toss:** Add the crispy tofu back to the wok. Toss vigorously for 30 seconds until perfectly coated. Serve immediately over rice.
