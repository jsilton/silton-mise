## Chef's Note

General Tso's tofu brings the classic Chinese-American sauce to plant-based protein. The trick to crispy tofu that isn't soggy: toss the pressed tofu cubes in honey and hot sauce before coating with cornstarch and sesame seeds. This creates a sticky surface that the starch can fuse to, resulting in maximum crispiness even after glazing. Dark soy sauce gives the signature deep amber color. Serve immediately for best texture.

## Directions

1.  **The Bind:** Toss dry tofu cubes with honey and hot sauce. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and 3 tbsp cornstarch. Toss until every cube is "crusty."
2.  **The Fry:** Heat oil in a cast-iron skillet until 350°F. Fry tofu in a single layer for 4-5 minutes, turning once, until golden and very crisp. Remove to a sheet pan.
3.  **The Aromatics:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok. Sauté ginger, garlic, and dried chilies for 30 seconds. Add bell peppers and a splash of Shaoxing wine (if using).
4.  **The Simmer:** Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Add the broccoli.
5.  **The Glaze:** Immediately add the soy sauces, vinegar, sugar, and sesame oil. Stir in the cornstarch slurry.
6.  **Bind:** Simmer for 1 minute until the sauce is thick and mirror-glossy.
7.  **Toss:** Add the crispy tofu back to the wok. Toss vigorously for 30 seconds until perfectly coated. Serve immediately over rice.
