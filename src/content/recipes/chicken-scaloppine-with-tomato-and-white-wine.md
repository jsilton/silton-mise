## Description
A rich, savory chicken dish that uses the Marsala method but with a tomato and white wine profile. Pounding the chicken ensures tenderness, while the tomato paste provides a deep umami base. Finished with a "beurre monté" (butter mount) for a glossy, restaurant-quality sauce.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Pound the chicken thighs to an even 1/2-inch thickness. This ensures they cook quickly and evenly.
2.  **Dredge:** Mix flour, salt, and pepper on a plate. Lightly coat each piece of chicken, shaking off any excess.
3.  **Sear:** Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear chicken for 4 minutes per side until golden and crisp. Remove to a plate.
4.  **Bloom:** Reduce heat to medium. Add garlic and tomato paste to the pan. Sauté for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the paste turns a deep brick-red.
5.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the white wine (or broth). Use a wooden spoon to scrape up all the browned bits (fond) from the bottom.
6.  **Simmer:** Add the 1/2 cup chicken broth and return the chicken to the pan. Simmer for 5 minutes until the sauce has thickened and chicken is cooked through.
7.  **Finish:** Turn heat to low. Stir in the cold butter cubes and the spinach. Toss until the butter is melted into a silky sauce and the spinach is just wilted. Serve immediately.
