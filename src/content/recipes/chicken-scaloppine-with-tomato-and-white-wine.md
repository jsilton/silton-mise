## Chef's Note

This dish uses the "Marsala Method" but pivots to a bright, Mediterranean profile. The secret to the deep color and umami is **Blooming the Paste**: we sauté the tomato paste with the garlic until it turns from bright red to a deep brick color—this removes the raw metallic taste and concentrates the sweetness. We maintain **Textural Balance** by folding the spinach in only during the final 30 seconds, so it stays vibrant green.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Place chicken thighs between plastic wrap and pound to a uniform 1/2-inch thickness.
2.  **Dredge:** Whisk flour, salt, and pepper. Lightly coat chicken, shaking off any excess.
3.  **Sear:** In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high. Sear chicken for 4 minutes per side until golden. Remove to a plate.
4.  **The Bloom:** Reduce heat to medium. Add garlic and tomato paste. Sauté for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the paste is fragrant and dark.
5.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the wine. Scrape up the fond. Add the chicken broth and return the chicken to the pan.
6.  **Simmer:** Cook for 5 minutes until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is tender.
7.  **The Mount:** Turn off the heat. Stir in the cold butter cubes and the spinach. Toss until the butter emulsifies into a silky glaze and the spinach is just wilted.
