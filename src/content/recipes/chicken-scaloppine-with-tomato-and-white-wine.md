## Chef's Note

Scaloppine refers to the Italian technique of pounding meat thin for quick cooking, typically done with veal in Italy but adapted to chicken in America. The dish comes from Northern Italy where white wine-based sauces are more common than the tomato-heavy Southern Italian cooking. Blooming tomato paste in hot oil is a chef's technique that caramelizes the sugars and removes the tinny, metallic taste of raw paste - you'll see it darken from bright red to deep brick. Thighs are more forgiving than breasts here and won't dry out if you cook them an extra minute.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Place chicken thighs between plastic wrap and pound to a uniform 1/2-inch thickness.
2.  **Dredge:** Whisk flour, salt, and pepper. Lightly coat chicken, shaking off any excess.
3.  **Sear:** In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high. Sear chicken for 4 minutes per side until golden. Remove to a plate.
4.  **The Bloom:** Reduce heat to medium. Add garlic and tomato paste. Sauté for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the paste is fragrant and dark.
5.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the wine. Scrape up the fond. Add the chicken broth and return the chicken to the pan.
6.  **Simmer:** Cook for 5 minutes until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is tender.
7.  **The Mount:** Turn off the heat. Stir in the cold butter cubes and the spinach. Toss until the butter emulsifies into a silky glaze and the spinach is just wilted.
