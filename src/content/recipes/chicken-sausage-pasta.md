## Chef's Note

This is a modern Italian-American weeknight staple that combines the convenience of pre-made chicken sausage with the technique of building flavor through layering. Chicken sausage became popular in the 1990s as a leaner alternative to pork, though purists would argue nothing beats traditional Italian sausage's richness. San Marzano tomatoes from the volcanic soil near Mount Vesuvius have protected DOP status and are worth seeking out for their sweet, low-acid flavor. Don't skip the red wine reduction - it adds depth that makes this taste like it simmered for hours.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water for 1 minute **less** than package instructions. **Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water.**
2.  **Sear:** In a large skillet, heat oil. Brown the sausage slices until crispy. Remove to a plate.
3.  **The Base:** Sauté the bell pepper and garlic in the same pan for 3 minutes.
4.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the red wine. Scrape the bottom of the pan and let it reduce for 2 minutes.
5.  **Simmer:** Add the tomatoes and dried basil. Simmer for 10 minutes to thicken.
6.  **Combine:** Return the sausage to the pan. Add the hot pasta and the spinach.
7.  **Bind:** Toss vigorously over medium heat, adding pasta water a tablespoon at a time until the sauce is glossy and the spinach is wilted.
8.  **Finish:** Stir in the Parmesan and plenty of black pepper.
