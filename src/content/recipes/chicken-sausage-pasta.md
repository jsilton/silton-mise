## Chef's Note

The secret to this weeknight hero is **Flavor Layering**. We start by browning the sausage to render its fat, then use that flavorful oil to sauté the peppers and garlic. The **Red Wine Reduction** provides a deep, slightly acidic base that complements the sweetness of the San Marzano tomatoes. The spinach is folded in at the very end to stay vibrant and green.

## Directions

1.  **Boil:** Cook pasta in salted water for 1 minute **less** than package instructions. **Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water.**
2.  **Sear:** In a large skillet, heat oil. Brown the sausage slices until crispy. Remove to a plate.
3.  **The Base:** Sauté the bell pepper and garlic in the same pan for 3 minutes.
4.  **Deglaze:** Pour in the red wine. Scrape the bottom of the pan and let it reduce for 2 minutes.
5.  **Simmer:** Add the tomatoes and dried basil. Simmer for 10 minutes to thicken.
6.  **Combine:** Return the sausage to the pan. Add the hot pasta and the spinach.
7.  **Bind:** Toss vigorously over medium heat, adding pasta water a tablespoon at a time until the sauce is glossy and the spinach is wilted.
8.  **Finish:** Stir in the Parmesan and plenty of black pepper.
