## Chef's Note

Pounding pork butt to uniform 3/4-inch thickness breaks down tough connective tissue and ensures it sears at the same rate as the fruit. Grilling peaches in butter until soft and slightly charred caramelizes their sugars while developing acidity that cuts through the rich, rosemary-crusted pork. This classic American summer pairing showcases stone fruit at peak season.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Place butterflied pork on a board. Use a meat mallet to pound to an even 3/4-inch thickness. Season aggressively with salt and pepper.
2.  **The Paste:** In a small bowl, whisk garlic, rosemary, and 6 tbsp of the olive oil into a thick paste. Rub the paste over both sides of the pork.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat a large cast-iron griddle or grill to high. Brush with remaining oil. Place pork on the heat and sear **without moving** for 8-10 minutes until a deep crust forms.
4.  **The Fruit:** While pork sears, place the peach halves (cut-side down) around the meat. Dot the fruit with the diced butter. Grill for 5 minutes until soft and charred. Transfer peaches to a platter.
5.  **Flip:** Turn the pork over and cook for another 5-7 minutes until the internal temp reaches 145°F (for a perfect blush pink).
6.  **Rest:** Remove meat to a carving board and **rest for 5 minutes** (mandatory for structure).
7.  **Serve:** Slice the pork and serve immediately with the buttery, charred peaches and any pan juices.
