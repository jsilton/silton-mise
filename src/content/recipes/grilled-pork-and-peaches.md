## Chef's Note

This dish is a masterclass in **Modern Heritage** flavor pairing. The secret to succulent pork butt on the grill is **The Mallet Pattern**: you must pound the pork to a uniform 3/4-inch thickness; this breaks down tough connective tissue and ensures it sears at the same rate as the fruit. We maintain **Texture Integrity** through **The Peach Char**: we grill the peaches in butter and their own juices until just soft and slightly blackened—this creates a natural **Acid Finish** that cuts through the rich, rosemary-crusted pork.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Place butterflied pork on a board. Use a meat mallet to pound to an even 3/4-inch thickness. Season aggressively with salt and pepper.
2.  **The Paste:** In a small bowl, whisk garlic, rosemary, and 6 tbsp of the olive oil into a thick paste. Rub the paste over both sides of the pork.
3.  **The Sear:** Heat a large cast-iron griddle or grill to high. Brush with remaining oil. Place pork on the heat and sear **without moving** for 8-10 minutes until a deep crust forms.
4.  **The Fruit:** While pork sears, place the peach halves (cut-side down) around the meat. Dot the fruit with the diced butter. Grill for 5 minutes until soft and charred. Transfer peaches to a platter.
5.  **Flip:** Turn the pork over and cook for another 5-7 minutes until the internal temp reaches 145°F (for a perfect blush pink).
6.  **Rest:** Remove meat to a carving board and **rest for 5 minutes** (mandatory for structure).
7.  **Serve:** Slice the pork and serve immediately with the buttery, charred peaches and any pan juices.
