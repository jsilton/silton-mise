## Directions

1. Place the sugar cube in an Old Fashioned glass and saturate with bitters. Add a splash of water.

2. Muddle the sugar until dissolved (or simply add simple syrup instead).

3. Add the whiskey and fill the glass with one large ice cube.

4. Stir gently for 10-15 seconds.

5. Express an orange peel over the drink by holding it over the glass and giving it a good twist to release the oils. Rub the peel around the rim of the glass and drop it in.

6. Optionally add a maraschino cherry. Serve immediately.

## Chef's Note

The Old Fashioned dates to the 1880s, when bartenders started getting fancy with cocktails, adding fruit and elaborate garnishes. Patrons who wanted their drinks made the 'old fashioned way' - just whiskey, sugar, water, and bitters - gave the drink its name. It represents the original cocktail formula before mixology got complicated, and experienced a massive revival in the 21st century craft cocktail movement. Use a large single ice cube instead of small cubes to minimize dilution while keeping the drink properly chilled.
