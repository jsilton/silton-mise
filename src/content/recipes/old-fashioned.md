The Old Fashioned is arguably the original cocktail, dating back to the early 1800s. This timeless drink showcases quality whiskey enhanced with just a touch of sugar and bitters, built directly in the glass over ice.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz bourbon or rye whiskey
- 1 sugar cube (or 1/4 oz simple syrup)
- 2-3 dashes Angostura bitters
- Orange peel
- Maraschino cherry (optional)
- Large ice cube

## Directions

1. Place the sugar cube in an Old Fashioned glass and saturate with bitters. Add a splash of water.

2. Muddle the sugar until dissolved (or simply add simple syrup instead).

3. Add the whiskey and fill the glass with one large ice cube.

4. Stir gently for 10-15 seconds.

5. Express an orange peel over the drink by holding it over the glass and giving it a good twist to release the oils. Rub the peel around the rim of the glass and drop it in.

6. Optionally add a maraschino cherry. Serve immediately.

## Chef's Note

The Old Fashioned has been bastardized over the years with muddled fruit and excessive sweetness. Keep it classic: just whiskey, sugar, bitters, and citrus oils. Use a large ice cube to minimize dilution. Bourbon provides a sweeter, rounder drink while rye gives more spice and complexity. Never muddle the orange peel - you want the oils, not the bitter pith.
