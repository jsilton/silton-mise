## Chef's Note

These are the perfect nutritious snacks for on-the-go. The secret to **Textural Balance** here is the **Compression Method**: when scooping the mixture, you must press it firmly into the spoon or scoop. This ensures the egg and cheese can bind the quinoa and broccoli into a dense, "bouncy" bite that doesn't crumble. We use finely chopped fresh broccoli rather than frozen to maintain a slight Crunch even after baking.

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly grease with oil spray.
2.  **Mix:** In a large bowl, toss the cooked quinoa, chopped broccoli, cheddar, and green onions.
3.  **Bind:** Stir in the beaten eggs, Parmesan, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix until every grain of quinoa is coated in the egg mixture.
4.  **Compress:** Using a small cookie scoop or tablespoon, scoop the mixture and **press it firmly** against the side of the bowl to compact it. Place on the baking sheet.
5.  **Bake:** Bake for 20-25 minutes until the edges are golden brown and the bites feel firm to the touch.
6.  **The Rest:** Let the bites rest on the pan for 5 minutes before moving—this allows the cheese to "set," ensuring they hold their shape.
