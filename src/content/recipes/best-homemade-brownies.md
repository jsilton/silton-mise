## Chef's Note

The secret to the Kitchen Standard brownie is **Textural Balance**. By using **Extra-Virgin Olive Oil** instead of butter or canola, we achieve a fruitier depth that perfectly pairs with dark chocolate. The addition of **Powdered Sugar** in the dry mix is a structural hack—it creates that iconic "shackle" or paper-thin, crackly crust on top while keeping the middle fudgy and dense. Never over-mix once the dry ingredients are added; you want to preserve the "snap."

## Directions

1.  **Prep:** Preheat oven to 325°F. Spray an 8x8 baking pan and line with parchment paper so it hangs over the edges. Spray the parchment too.
2.  **Dry Mix:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, cocoa, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.
3.  **Wet Mix:** In a large bowl, whisk eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla until well combined and slightly frothy.
4.  **Combine:** Sprinkle the dry ingredients over the wet. Fold gently with a spatula until **just combined**. The batter will be very thick.
5.  **Bake:** Spread evenly in the prepared pan. Bake for 40-45 minutes until a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs.
6.  **The Finish:** Allow to cool completely in the pan for at least 2 hours before slicing. This is mandatory for the structure to set.
