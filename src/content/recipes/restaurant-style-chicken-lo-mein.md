## Chef's Note

Cantonese lo mein is a tossed noodle dish that relies on fresh egg noodles and a light soy-based sauce, distinguishing it from the heavier, soupier chow mein. Velveting the chicken in cornstarch and water keeps the meat tender during high-heat stir-frying, while dark soy sauce provides the characteristic bronze color of Chinese-American takeout.

## Directions

1.  **Velvet:** Toss chicken with cornstarch, water, and oil. Let stand for 15 minutes.
2.  **The Sear:** Heat a wok until smoking. Add 2 tbsp oil. Sear chicken for 2 minutes until browned. remove.
3.  **Aromatics:** Add fresh oil and garlic. Sauté for 10 seconds. Add cabbage and carrots. Stir-fry for 1 minute.
4.  **Deglaze:** Pour the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok.
5.  **Combine:** Add the fresh noodles and chicken back to the wok. If the noodles are stuck, add 1/4 cup water.
6.  **The Steam:** Cover the wok for exactly 1 minute to soften the vegetables.
7.  **The Glaze:** Remove lid. Add both soy sauces, sesame oil, and sugar. Stir-fry for 30 seconds until the noodles are evenly dark and glossy.
8.  **Finish:** Fold in the mung bean sprouts and scallions. Toss for 30 more seconds and serve immediately.
