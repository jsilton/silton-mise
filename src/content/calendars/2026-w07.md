| Saturday  | [[greek-night]]                 | Valentine's feast - lamb burgers with tzatziki |

## Shopping Strategy

- **Sunday**: Load slow cooker
- **Valentine's Saturday**: Fresh lamb, quality feta, nice wine
- **Mid-week**: Fresh fish x2

## Cuisine Rotation

- Indian (1), Chinese (1), Mexican (1), Mediterranean (2), Italian (1), Greek (1)

## Special Notes

Valentine's Day falls on Saturday - Greek lamb burgers make an impressive but achievable dinner. Could swap for more elaborate meal if entertaining.
