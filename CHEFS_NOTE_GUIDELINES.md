# Chef's Note Guidelines

## Purpose
The Chef's Note provides cultural context, historical background, and one memorable detail about each recipe. It's the human touch that makes cooking more meaningful than just following instructions.

## Structure (2-3 sentences)

### Sentence 1-2: Origin/Culture/Story
Focus on:
- Historical origins and timeline
- Cultural significance (holidays, traditions, regional importance)
- How the dish evolved or spread
- Interesting backstory or legend
- Why it matters to a particular culture or community

### Sentence 3: One Special Note
End with ONE practical insight:
- A key ingredient that makes a difference
- An important technique or timing consideration
- A common mistake to avoid
- A memorable sensory detail
- What makes this version special

## What to AVOID
- ❌ Buzzwords: "Kitchen Standard," "Culinary Technique," "High Note"
- ❌ Self-promotion: "definitive version," "restaurant quality," "ultimate"
- ❌ Marketing speak: "technical comfort food," "baseline for quick fuel"
- ❌ Obvious statements: "delicious," "perfect for weeknight," "crowd-pleaser"
- ❌ Over-capitalized terms: "The Maillard Roast Method"
- ❌ Unnecessary quotes around common terms

## Examples

**Good:**
> "Despite its Italian name and Sicilian wine, Chicken Marsala is purely Italian-American, created in New York trattorias during the post-WWII boom when returning soldiers craved the flavors they'd encountered abroad. It became a staple of red-sauce joints in the 1950s-70s, alongside Chicken Parmigiana and Veal Piccata. A quality dry Marsala (look for 'Superiore' or 'Vergine' on the label) transforms this from a weeknight dinner into something restaurant-worthy."

**Bad:**
> "This is the definitive version of a restaurant classic. The depth of flavor comes from three critical layers: rendering the fat from the prosciutto, browning the mushrooms until they are meaty and concentrated, and using Dry Marsala instead of the overly-sweet variety. We finish the dish by 'mounting' cold butter off the heat, which creates a glossy, thick emulsion."

## Tone
- Conversational and engaging
- Educational without being preachy
- Respectful of cultural origins
- Personal but not overly casual
