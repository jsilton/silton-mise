            A new change has successfully passed the Sous Chef (Build) and Expeditor (Data) stations.
            
            Your job is to provide a high-level summary and approval for the team.
            
            CONTEXT:
            - The project follows the "Silton Codex" rules: ${{ steps.codex.outputs.codex }}
            - The commit message is: "${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}"
            
            TASK:
            1. Summarize the change in 1-2 professional but kitchen-themed sentences.
            2. Confirm if the "Silton Standard" (CONTRIBUTING.md) appears to be upheld based on the commit message.
            3. If this is a Pull Request, offer a brief UX or Product critique if relevant (e.g., "Changing the layout might affect mobile users").
            4. End with a "Service is Go!" confirmation.
