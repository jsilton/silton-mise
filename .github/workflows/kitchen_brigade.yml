      # If changes were pushed, this run stops (because the code on disk is now "old" compared to remote),
      # and we rely on the `[skip ci]` to NOT trigger a loop, but effectively the repo is now clean.
      # However, for safety, let's build anyway to ensure the *result* of the fix is valid.
