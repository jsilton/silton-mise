            <p class="line">Pumpkin Cookies</p><p class="line">Whisk together 1 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp salt in a medium-sized bowl. Set aside.</p><p class="line">Cream together 1/2 cup butter, 2/3 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar with a stand or hand mixer until the mixture lightens in color (about 1 minute). Add 1/3 cup pumpkin puree and mix on a medium speed until combined. If you want your cookies to look orange, add in a drop of orange gel food coloring with the pumpkin puree.</p><p class="line">Mix the dry ingredients into the butter /sugar mixture on a low speed until just combined. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed with a rubber spatula.</p><p class="line">Use a cookie scoop or spoon to make 2 1/2 Tbsp balls of cookie dough. There should be enough dough to make 12 cookie dough balls. Place them on a parchment lined baking sheet and chill in the fridge for about an hour. You can chill the dough longer than this, but it makes the dough a bit more challenging to flatten and fill.</p><p class="line">Cheesecake Filling</p><p class="line">While the cookie dough chills, make the cheesecake filling. Use an electric mixer to beat together 3/4 cup cream cheese, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Mix on a medium-high speed until combined and smooth.</p><p class="line">Use a spoon to scoop about 12 dollops (each should be about 1 Tbsp) of the cheesecake filling onto a parchment lined plate or tray. Place in the freezer for at least 45 minutes or until they&apos;re chilled and easy to handle. They won&apos;t become completely hard, but they should become much easier to pick up once they&apos;re chilled.</p><p class="line">My oven takes a while to preheat, so I usually turn it on once I&apos;ve finished making this filling. Preheat your oven to 350 F / 175 C.</p><p class="line">Cinnamon Sugar Coating</p><p class="line">While the dough and the filling chill, make the cinnamon sugar. In a small bowl, whisk together 1/3 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp ginger. Set aside.</p><p class="line">Assembling the Pumpkin Cheesecake Cookies</p><p class="line">If you haven&apos;t already, preheat your oven to 350 F / 175 C while the cookie dough chills and line two large cookie sheets with parchment paper or silicon mats.</p><p class="line">Remove the cookie dough and cheesecake dollops from the fridge and freezer.</p><p class="line">Flatten the cookie dough balls in the palm of your hand and place the cheesecake filling in the center. If you have warm hands, flatten the cookie dough between two sheets of parchment paper.</p><p class="line">Place a dollop of cheesecake in the center and wrap the overhanging cookie dough around the filling, doing your best to cover it. If there is a little bit of cheesecake filling peeking through, don&apos;t worry! Just make that the bottom of the cookie when you bake them. They&apos;ll still bake up just fine! If you notice the cookie dough or cheesecake filling is getting too soft to handle, pop the dough in the fridge and the cheesecake filling in the freezer to make them easier to handle.</p><p class="line">Toss the cookies in the cinnamon sugar until they&apos;re fully coated. You&apos;ll end up having a bit of cinnamon sugar leftover. I like to sprinkle mine over buttered toast to make cinnamon toast.</p><p class="line">Place the cookie dough balls on the lined baking sheets, spacing them about 3 inches apart. Flatten them a bit with your fingers by gently pressing down on top of each cookie.</p><p class="line">Bake for 16-19 minutes, or until the cookies have set on the outside. Place them on a wire rack to cool, then enjoy!</p><p class="line">Leftover cookies can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 10 days. I like them best cold, straight out of the fridge!</p><p class="line">Making These Pumpkin Cheesecake Cookies in Advance and Storing Them</p><p class="line">If you have leftover cookies or if you make these ahead of time, they can be stored in an airtight container for up to 10 days in the fridge. They age super well, and I swear they actually taste best a couple days in!</p><p class="line">You can also freeze baked cookies for up to a month. I like to thaw them in the fridge overnight, then heat them in the microwave for 10-15 seconds to make the centers gooey again.</p><p class="line">If you make the cookie dough in advance, you can freeze stuffed cookies in an airtight container for up to a month. Let the cookies thaw in the fridge overnight, then bake as instructed.</p>

            <p>Tips for Making the Best Pumpkin Cheesecake Cookies</p><p>Chilling your cookie dough is a must! It&apos;s almost impossible to fill these cookies if the dough isn&apos;t chilled. I find they&apos;re easiest to roll out when they&apos;ve been in the fridge for about an hour.</p><p>Use a cookie scoop to make sure your cookies are uniformly sized.</p><p>Thoroughly coat each cookie with cinnamon sugar. It really adds the the texture and flavor of these cookies.</p><p>Add in a small squirt of orange gel food coloring when you mix in the pumpkin puree to give these colors a little pop of color.</p><p>If you have warm hands, flatten the cookie dough between two sheets of parchment paper.</p><p>Don&apos;t worry if there&apos;s a little bit of cheesecake filling peaking through a small crack in the cookie dough. It will bake up just fine and be covered with cinnamon sugar!</p><p>Space your cookies about 3 inches apart before baking them. They will spread as they bake.</p><p>Don&apos;t over-bake your cookies! They don&apos;t really brown, so you have to keep an eye on the texture of the top of the cookie. Even if they seem a bit soft coming out of the oven, they will continue to bake and set on the tray once they&apos;re out of the oven.</p>
