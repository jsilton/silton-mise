            <p class="line"><strong>How to steam broccoli? It&apos;s easy! Scroll down to the recipe card for detailed instructions. Here are the basic steps:</strong></p><p class="line">You start by placing the florets in a steamer basket. Steam them until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes.</p><p class="line">Meanwhile, quickly prepare the dressing by whisking together the remaining ingredients.</p><p class="line">The final step is to toss the cooked broccoli florets with the dressing and serve.</p><p class="line">EXPERT TIP</p><p class="line">Timing this dish when it&apos;s part of a complete meal can be challenging. Sometimes I find that the broccoli is ready, but the rest of the meal isn&apos;t.</p><p class="line">It&apos;s tempting to keep it warm by keeping it in the steaming basket, covered. But I think that&apos;s a mistake. It&apos;s better to enjoy crisp broccoli at room temperature than to suffer through mushy, limp, warm broccoli!</p><p class="line">So as soon as the broccoli is ready, remove it onto a platter. Dress it with the olive oil-lemon dressing, loosely cover with foil, and serve when the rest of the meal is ready.</p><p class="line">Unless you prefer broccoli with cheese sauce, in which case the broccoli should be the last thing you make. You want the cheese sauce warm and gooey.</p><p class="line">How do you season broccoli?</p><p class="line">Simple is best, in my opinion. I season this dish with olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. That&apos;s it! As long as the broccoli is nice and crisp, it&apos;s going to be delicious even with just a sprinkle of salt.</p><p class="line">You can also use a little melted butter instead of olive oil. I&apos;ve tried both versions and both are excellent.</p><p class="line">Can I steam broccoli without a steamer?</p><p class="line">The easiest way is to use your microwave and make microwave broccoli.</p><p class="line">Another option is to place the broccoli directly in one inch of boiling water. It&apos;s not ideal, because the parts that are submerged in the water will actually boil. But it&apos;s probably better than completely submerging it in water.</p><p class="line">RECOMMENDED MAIN DISHES</p><p class="line">This is such a versatile side dish. It goes with anything, really. I often serve it with pork roast, with baked chicken breast, or with baked salmon. It&apos;s also good with a couple of fried eggs for a tasty and filling meatless dinner.</p><p class="line">STORING LEFTOVERS</p><p class="line">You can keep the leftovers in the fridge, in an airtight container, for 3-4 days. Reheat them gently, in the microwave on 50% power. They won&apos;t be as good as when served fresh, though. Sometimes I just add them cold to a salad.</p><p class="line">Add 1 inch of water to a saucepan and bring to a boil.</p><p class="line">Rinse the broccoli. Use a vegetable peeler to peel the stalks.</p><p class="line">Cut the broccoli into bite-size florets and pieces, and place ina steamer basket.</p><p class="line">Steam until tender-crisp. Start checking after 5 minutes. As soon as a fork can pierce the stalks, the broccoli is done. Even if the rest of the meal is not ready yet, remove the broccoli from the steamer onto a plate. Crisp steamed broccoli is delicious even at room temperature. Warm limp broccoli is not.</p><p class="line">While the broccoli is steaming, in a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.</p><p class="line">Place the steamed broccoli in a bowl. Pour the dressing on top and gently mix. Serve immediately.</p>
