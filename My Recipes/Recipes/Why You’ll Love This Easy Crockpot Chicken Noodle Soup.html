            <p class="line">Add Everything to a Slow Cooker. Cover and cook on LOW for 4 to 6 hours or HIGH for 2 to 3 hours.</p><p class="line">Shred the Chicken. Discard the onion and fresh herbs.</p><p class="line">Cook the Noodles. Add them to the slow cooker with the chicken. ENJOY!</p><p class="line">Recipe Variations</p><p class="line">Crockpot Chicken Noodle Soup with Potatoes. I haven’t tried this myself, but I think incorporating some cubed potatoes would be tasty. Dice them small so they cook in the same amount of time as the chicken.</p><p class="line">Slow Cooker Chicken Rice Soup. Prefer crockpot chicken soup no noodles? Try my Crock Pot Chicken and Rice Soup instead.</p><p class="line">Creamy Chicken Noodle Soup. For those who prefer their chicken noodle soup a little creamier.</p><p class="line">Storage Tips</p><p class="line">To Store. Place cooked and cooled chicken soup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p><p class="line">To Reheat. Rewarm soup gently in a medium saucepan on the stovetop over medium-low heat until hot. You can also reheat the soup in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave until warmed through.</p><p class="line">To Freeze. Store cooked and cooled soup in an airtight, freezer-safe storage container in the freezer for up to 3 months. Let thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating.</p><p class="line">What to Serve With Chicken Noodle Soup</p><p class="line">Salad. Keep it simple with a classic Arugula Salad, or pair it with this Panera-style Spinach Strawberry Salad.</p><p class="line">Bread. Dunk it! Try this soup with a slice of Beer Bread, Sweet Potato Cornbread, Rosemary Olive Oil Bread or Homemade Dinner Rolls.</p><p class="line">Crackers. Ranch Crackers are a tasty choice with this soup.</p><p class="line">Sandwiches. Make your meal a combo with a half (or whole) portion of a Chickpea Salad Sandwich, BLT, Chicken Caesar Wrap, or Air Fryer Grilled Cheese.</p><p class="line">Recommended Tools to Make this Recipe</p><p class="line">Slow Cooker. With this slow cooker, you can skip the stovetop chicken noodle soup.</p><p class="line">Ladle. Perfect for serving soups and stews.</p><p class="line">Instant Read Thermometer. The best way to check your chicken for doneness.</p><p class="line">Recipe Tips and Tricks</p><p class="line">Use a Whole Onion. Instead of using diced raw onion, I put in 1 whole, peeled onion that I remove at the end of the cooking time. It imparts the onion flavor but is not nearly as off-putting as when raw onion is used. It also saves you the step of sautéing the onion first.</p><p class="line">Swap the Herbs. Not a rosemary fanatic? Swap a bundle of fresh thyme. You can leave out the bundle and top the final soup with chopped fresh dill, oregano, or basil.</p><p class="line">Cook the Noodles Separately. While you can add uncooked noodles to a crockpot, I found the best results in cooking them separately on the stove. Noodles can’t achieve that perfect al dente bite in the slow cooker and tend to fall apart.</p><p class="line">Try Bone Broth. While I love the idea of making homemade broth using bone-in chicken, I typically don’t have the time. A high-quality storebought bone broth is a great option to get the same flavor and nutritional benefits with less effort (swap it for the chicken stock).</p><p class="line">To the bottom of a 6-quart or larger slow cooker, add the chicken breasts. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add the whole onion, carrots, celery, garlic, rosemary bundle, and bay leaf. Pour 6 cups of the chicken stock over the top. Cover and cook on LOW for 4 to 6 hours or HIGH for 2 to 3 hours, until the chicken is cooked through and reaches an internal temperature of 165°F. The cooking time can vary greatly depending on your slow cooker model, so check the thickest part of the chicken for doneness early to ensure it does not overcook.</p><p class="line">Remove the chicken from the slow cooker to a large mixing bowl or plate. Fish out and discard the whole onion, bay leaf, and rosemary springs (don’t worry if a few of the rosemary leaves are left in the soup). Shred the chicken—a hand mixer, two forks, or your fingers (if the chicken is cool enough) all work well for shredding. Set the shredded chicken aside.</p><p class="line">To cook the noodles on the stove (the best option so that you don’t worry about them over- or undercooking and so the noodles stay more intact): Towards the end of the soup’s cook time, cook the egg noodles until al dente according to package directions. Drain and add to the soup when the soup has finished cooking. Add back the shredded chicken. Stir and let cook on LOW for 5 minutes to absorb some of the flavor.</p><p class="line">To cook noodles directly in the slow cooker (the best option if you are willing to risk less-than-perfect noodles for the sake of not washing a separate pasta pot): Add the uncooked egg noodles to the soup. Cook on LOW for 10 minutes, or until al dente. Stir in the shredded chicken.</p><p class="line">Add as much of the remaining 1 cup chicken stock as you like to reach your desired consistency. (If you cooked your noodles in the slow cooker, you may also need to add some additional stock since the noodles absorb the stock as they cook). Serve hot with a sprinkle of fresh parsley.</p>
