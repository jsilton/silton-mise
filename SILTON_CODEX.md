THE SILTON CODEX
Profile of the Executive Chef & Family Palate Version 1.0

The Mission
The Silton kitchen is currently transitioning from a disorganized collection of random recipes into a strategic, high-performance culinary operating system known as silton-mise. The ultimate goal is to curate a locked library of exactly 70 "Gold Standard" recipes that solve specific logistical problems for a busy family, ranging from Tuesday night fatigue to Sunday afternoon comfort. This system prioritizes quality over quantity, meaning every recipe exists to fill a specific functional gap, such as "Speed," "Fuel," or "Heritage," and new additions must displace old ones to maintain the limit.

The Palate & Texture Profile
The family has very specific, non-negotiable preferences regarding texture and flavor that guide all culinary decisions. They have a strong aversion to capers and water chestnuts due to their specific textures, though they appreciate the acidity of lemon and the crunch of fresh vegetables like celery or apples as substitutes. While there are no medical nut allergies, the family prefers to avoid nut-heavy dishes, opting for seeds like sunflower or sesame when a nutty flavor profile is needed. They generally dislike "mushy" textures, preferring roasted squash over boiled and blended soups over chunky vegetable stews. Conversely, they highly value the "snap" and "crunch" of textures typically found in restaurant-quality Asian cuisine, achieved through high-heat searing or air-frying rather than deep-frying.

The Nutritional Philosophy ("The Fuel Protocol")
The family views food as fuel and places a high premium on nutrient density, particularly regarding dark, leafy greens. A "salad" in this kitchen is rarely just iceberg lettuce; it is expected to be a vehicle for antioxidants, utilizing massaged kale, peppery arugula, or cooked Swiss chard. They prefer to integrate vegetables seamlessly into meals, such as using sweet potato purées to thicken chili naturally. When it comes to protein, there is a distinct preference for lamb and ground turkey over beef, though they will occasionally enjoy a high-quality steak or brisket for special occasions. They aim to balance heavy comfort foods with lighter, acid-forward sides to avoid feeling weighed down during the week.

The Culinary Standards
This kitchen operates under the belief that home cooking should rival restaurant quality through the application of proper food science rather than shortcuts. The family respects the "why" behind cooking—understanding that mounting a sauce with cold butter creates emulsion, or that "velveting" chicken is essential for proper stir-fry texture. They rely on trusted, high-authority sources like J. Kenji López-Alt, Alton Brown, and specialized cultural experts like Dishoom or Rick Bayless, avoiding generic recipe aggregators. Techniques like pressure cooking are embraced for their ability to tenderize meats like ribs or pork shoulder efficiently, while the wok is respected for its ability to generate "wok hei" in small batches.

The Family Logistics
The menu planning revolves around a structured rhythm designed to minimize decision fatigue. Mondays and Tuesdays are strictly reserved for fast, high-protein "Speed" or "Fuel" meals that take under 30 minutes of active time. Wednesdays are often designated for pasta or Italian dishes, provided they aren't overly heavy on cream. Thursdays are flexible "bowl" nights for clearing out the fridge, while Fridays and weekends allow for more complex "Comfort" meals or "Projects" that involve longer cooking times and family participation. The Thanksgiving menu is a specific, locked "Heritage" bundle that honors family tradition and is not subject to the usual rotation rules.
